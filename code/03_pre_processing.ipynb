    "\n",
    "Provided with numerous posts on Reddit, I had a binary classification problem on hand to see if a difference could be infered between depression and bipolar posts. After scraping two subreddits, I compared Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and KNN models to finetune one that would perform the best. My main concern was measuring the accuracy of the model. After, choosing my model, I went ahead and train my model to make real time predictions. In the 'real_time_predictions' subfolder you will find a code that if ran will tell you with some accuracy whether the person who wrote a paragraph about how they feel should be treated for bipolar or depression.
