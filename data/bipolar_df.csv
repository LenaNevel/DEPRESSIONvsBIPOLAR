I do admit that my inability to leave the house is very bad, and I am extremely suicidal but I just hate that I feel like that’s who I am, or that’s just something that I do (in a fucked up way) miss.

I was officially diagnosed with BP II and am taking lamictal for it as of last week. As much as I want to live a normal happy, healthy life I can’t help but wonder if my neurodiversity is a gift. I went to the Van Gogh museum and looked up if he had BP because his symptoms sounded familiar, and lo and behold. While he suffered so much and ultimately killed himself he also gave so much to the world and had a beautiful mind. It just feels so cruel and unfair that I can feel these highs that feel like my best self but I must deny and suppress them because each one brings me closer to degeneration and of course the lows are insufferable. 

More than anything I wish I could just talk to my dad. He is also bipolar, borderline, and probably schizophrenic. We haven’t talked in 8 years and I have ptsd from him stalking me and threatening me and my family two summers ago when I was taking a solo ride trip. This disease and his behaviors have wrecked him and his relationships and it makes me so incredibly sad. I just wish I could have a good conversation with him because he’s me dad and could probably understand what I’m going through right now more than anyone else. I’m afraid though that if I call him he’ll fixate on me again and try to hurt me or my mom. I think he may be dying and I’m scared if I pass up on this opportunity I’ll regret it for the rest of my life.

Thinking about pulling off the road into a tree, or meditating on the thought of what it will feel like to be truly dead, all feel as average to me as thinking about dinner. Until I realize that’s not average, and maybe something is “wrong”. 

I keep using quotes around “wrong” because I don’t agree with that. I think that trying to convince people not to complete suicide is what is actually fucking selfish. If people that loved me were truly selfless and interested in what’s best for me, they would stop trying to convince me that suicide is wrong. Or that I shouldn’t do it. No one knows what is right for me but me, and I wish people understood death by suicide in the same way as “death with dignity”. 

On that note, I’m not going to kill myself right now. I just really needed to get this out of my fucking head to someone, anyone, because my therapist is ghosting me at the moment (lovely).

I have not been medicated, but I've been doing therapy sessions every single week for upkeep and all that jazz. I see the new psychiatrist in a couple of weeks. It has been hard. A lot of stuff happened. Overall though?

I'm happy. I can finally say, after some really freaking tough situations, that I am happy. I have health insurance, I have friends, I met someone. Even though I know what comes up must come down, I'm looking at the future optimistically. I'm crocheting again. I'm writing again (after not writing for two years).

I’m also a sixteen year old male 

So my mother is bipolar and OCD. My father used to have ADHD and has OCD. My father’s father is schizophrenic. Depression and anxiety is something literally every family member including me has struggled with. Other mood disorders I’m not aware of run in my family

But anyway, the reason I’m scared about this is because I seem to flip between what you all describe as the depression and mania. I didn’t really think about this until recently because the last couple months, my symptoms have worsened significantly

Thinking about it, my symptoms seem to have been going on since I was about 14 or 15. I’d randomly get depressed for no reason for days or weeks. I also would have the same for mania where I would be extremely productive and never sleep. I ended up teaching myself a lot of German plus a bunch of other things but that’s the most notable 

One thing that confuses me though is I recently experienced an episode that lasted about 2.5 hours. I flipped between extremely intense various emotions. Particularly intense agitation, anxiety, fear, anger and then at the end I just felt depressed for the rest of the day. 

Sometimes I just scream out of anger. I don’t know where it comes from. But these parts don’t seem bipolar. At least from what I’m aware of, bipolar isn’t sudden and short right?

I also have a lot of compulsions and intrusive thoughts which seems like an OCD thing but I don’t think I have OCD

Constantly being in fight or flight and having a depressive episode come into the mix means I called in sick often before my meds got sorted out.

I called in sick once after coming back from a holiday break and they took away hours and stated that one of the head managers told her to, and when I asked said assistant store manager he said I could have the hours. She then told me to ask store manager.
He said it was fine and I could have the hours.

Turns out she kept trying to take my hours because the other front store manager hates covering till for the measly hour before another one shows up.
This manager won’t even cover till if I go to the bathroom, he made a customer wait for me at the till when he was standing there doing fuck all.
He told her to change the schedule so I wouldn’t work on days he worked and she flat out lied about it.

Meanwhile I couldn’t cover rent without the hours and they had a posting in the staff room for 2 open full time positions for the weekend and hoped I would just be to intimidated to ask store manager for my hours back. One of the other managers told her to fix it.

Likely after hearing me vent to another coworker and said coworker telling me that they can’t do that.
No they really can’t. If I had my mental health file I could have made a complaint to HR, I literally thought the store manager told them to take me off for being unreliable, but really one specific manager hates having to work with customers and made an executive decision he had no right to make.

I’m mentioning this here because multiple users on this and other bipolar subreddits have tried saying that this has nothing to with my mental health despite the fact that I have had accommodations in high school and will for college that would prevent this kind of thing from preventing me from graduating.

I am not asking for a diagnosis per say but some more insight and help. I apologize if this IS against the rules I am just desperate for help.

So both my grandmother and sister are bipolar. I think I am pretty good at seeing symptoms if BPD but they appear different in everyone and I think my bf may be bipolar but it is hard for me to discern. The biggest thing is I have to travel a lot for work. Everytime I leave and he is in the house alone he gets anxiety and also starts to have a bit of mania. He stays up until 3 or 4 in the morning, lets the house become a mess, and tries to tackle multiple endeavors at once all while holding a full time job. However these manic/anxiety episodes also lead to him wanting to break up. I have been with him for 9 years and on a couple of occasions he will randomly decide he doesn’t want to be with me anymore. One time was while on a cruise I payed for us to go on. But then he comes down and changes his mind and doesn’t want to leave. More recently this happened while I was on vacation to see my family this past Christmas. He decided he was interested in a girl at work and was going to try and pursue her while I was gone. I found out and we got in a huge argument over it. I was gone for a week and I kid you not that I got multiple phone calls from him every day that all had the same pattern. He would call angry wanting to break up, saying he wants to date other people and answer to no one and be on his own. As the conversation continues his mood and tone start to change and all of the sudden he is breaking down in tears saying he loves me and doesn’t want to leave me. I didn’t really get to enjoy my time off because as I mentioned this happened every day while I was gone. 

I don’t know that this is BPD. My sister’s moods didn’t change that quickly or chaotically, nor my grandmother’s. When I read about rapid cycling it says that this is if the mood changes happen more than once a year or within a 6 month period or something to that effect, not within an hour and every day for a week. He refuses to see any sort of therapist or psychologist because he thinks there is nothing wrong with him and they are all con artists. It should also be important to mention his mom is schizophrenic but I haven’t seen him have delusions or anything related to it.

I donate to my local food bank when I can, I give money to the church when I can because I know they do good in the community, even if I am not sure I am 100% Christian.

I be as kind as I can be to everyone in my life and everyone I meet.

Walk my dog, journal, read and research anything I can get my hands on about bipolar, workout, eat well, re-budget everyday as I only get money once a month, play guitar, listen to music that moves me, listen to podcasts, visit family, keep up to date with friends new and old. Play computer games in-between.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I have a fufiling life, I help out anyone I can when ever I can, in whatever way I can.

I always can't help but think this is part of the general misconception about bipolar that it's not about just being 'moody' or having 'mood swings' but dealing with, y'know, depressive and manic episodes. I know during a manic and/or hypomanic episode being more easily irritated happens, but I kind of figure the other symptoms of both of those are a little bit more noticable and what people would be commenting on instead.

My own experience is a little bit limited; I have Bipolar Type 1 which has involved strong episodes but with limited frequency. Throughout my life I've had lots of intense episodes of depression and one severe manic episode resulting in hospitalisation. Since then I've thankfully found medication that works well for me and I've had a couple of hypomanic episodes but they've been well under control. 

I only know two other people who are diagnosed with bipolar; one is a friend who's a really sweet person, and the other was my grandmother who was ... a bit much. But a lot of that really had to do with who she was otherwise, not her illness.

It helps to get my thoughts out there. This is my first post in this sub.
Last week I was in the middle of a manic episode, I caught it immediately and set boundaries like not going out and shopping, stay away from Amazon, no new hobbies, no new subscriptions to anything. So manic me was like “Good job I’m proud of you... now you can cheat a bit”, so I broke other boundaries that I set last time like no dating, stay off tinder, don’t be a hoe, no hard drugs/psychedelics, etc. I downloaded tinder and a few days ago I ended up going on this date with this awesome girl. We initially were just supposed to meet up for ice cream but when we met up we both were hungry and got pizza instead. Then normal first date stuff ensues and we have great chemistry, similar interests, she’s my type everything’s going swell. We even talked for like 20 minutes before even looking at the menus. Towards the end of dinner she says that’s she’s still down to get ice cream in a bit we should just get our appetite back. I pay for the meal and we head back to her car to put more money on the meter and we decide to just chill in her car and we start showing each other music. I kiss her and we start making out and everything’s going great. She then asks if I smoke and I say I do, socially, and she offers to go back to her place for a smoke. So we head back to her place, she introduces me to her roommates and we head into her room. She changes into something more comfortable and as she’s packing the cone I decide to ask her what she’s looking for on tinder and she mentions that she’s not really looking for anything serious and I agree and tell her that I’m looking to take things slowly and if the right connection comes a long then great, she agrees. This is where things head south. I realize “Oh fuck, what are you doing, you don’t know this girl, you are LITERALLY in her room right now, this is not slow” so I start to retreat into my head and start to disassociate, I’m trying to remind myself that this isn’t serious, don’t get serious, you made it this far, you got this, power through it. Power through it was not the right play. So we go outside to smoke and I don’t know what I was thinking, I smoked way past my limit. We went back into her room, she put something up on YouTube and we laid in bed. After like 5 minutes I start making my move and we start cuddling. Then my body starts to twitch, and the marijuana induced paranoia hits me like a wave. I start to twitch while we’re cuddling and I begin to think “Oh no, I can’t stop it, she can feel it, she knows I’m breathing weird, she thinks I’m a freak, this is bad” I feel like my skeleton is trying to jump out of my skin. I’m try with every fiber of my being to calm down and I decide, you got to power through it, you got this. So we start to make out and it feels amazing for a few seconds until those intrusive thoughts come back. “You’re too slow, you’re too fast, too hard, too soft, she’s not into it, of course she is”. I’m trying to keep my composure but I can not get into it at this state. So it escalates we start to get undressed, I take off my shirt she takes off hers, she undoes my pants and starts touching me. When it comes to me and anything I need to be sure that the other person is enjoying themselves whether it be sex, friendship, anything, if I suspect that they’re not into it I shut down, in that moment my head was taking every sign that she was into it and warped it into the thought that I was inadequate and she was definitely not into. But I decide to try to power through it anyway. I take off her pants and go down on her and same issue “I’m too fast, too slow, she isn’t into it, etc” but I’m already here so I got to power through it. I take off my pants and then go back to kissing her and any feeling that she was into it was just gone and I shut down and stop. She asks me is everything okay and I just broke down. I start panicking and apologizing and she asks what’s wrong and if I’m okay. I was scared and I did the only thing I knew how to do, I told the truth. I told her “I’m bipolar and I’m sorry but I think I’m having an episode” she tells me it’s okay you’re okay, I understand. I continue, “I think with all the weed I smoked I’m feeling really paranoid” she says “Oh my god I’m so sorry I shouldn’t have given you all that weed”. I start to apologize more and say things like “I’m sorry for killing your vibe, I’m sorry for ruining it, for disappointing you, etc.” she stops me and says “It’s okay I liked what I got. And besides I’m really surprised I expected to just get ice cream and be done. I didn’t expect us to go back to my place and be doing this. I think you’re a really sweet guy. You’re welcome to stay as long as you need to calm down and then I’ll take you back to your car and you can get home. I’d let you stay the night but I do have school tomorrow at 9 so that wouldn’t work out”. We go back to cuddling at that point, and I’m rubbing her stomach, she was cramping and she said it helps and it’s helping me calm down to get my mind off of everything. That being said my mind is still racing, “She has to be terrified, any sane person would be uncomfortable right now, this is awful, I’m awful, etc”. She then just passes out right there and it surprises me. It’s good too I get to have some time to just calm down and think. This whole time I’m trying to interpret her body language (which in hindsight was really dumb because she’s sleeping next to me). I can’t tell if she was scared, just faking being comfortable, and was looking for anyway to get me out, any signal I was getting was being skewed by my head. I slowly calm down over the course of the next hour or so and she wakes up and touches my face a bit and says “I’m sorry I’m not good to drive, I’m way too tired”. I say “It’s fine I can Uber”, and she offers to Venmo me Uber money and I turn it down. I schedule a ride and we get our clothes back on. I apologize some more and she says “I had a great time, don’t you worry about it” and I ask if she’s just saying that and she makes me pinky promise on it. She walks me out, I do the walk of shame past her roommates and we’re on her porch and I’m much more calm now. I reinstate to her that “Im bipolar, and I’ve been manic all week, I think I just had a crash and that mixed with all the coffee I had today and the weed it was a bad concoction. I’m sorry you had to go through that.” She says “It’s okay and I’ll let you know what time I’m free next week and we can try this again”. At this point I’m shocked and just stand there, she hugs me and then gives me a kiss on the lips to my surprise, then tells me to let her know when I’m home, and we go our separate ways. I get back to my place and text her that I made it and somehow managed to get some sleep after that. When I woke up I was also surprised to see that she had not blocked me but texted me saying “glad you got home safe! I had a blast last night &amp; I definitely want to see you again!”

It seems like I’m in a mixed episode? just depressed? i’m not sure. I haven’t been able to go to class at all because I haven’t been able to sleep at night and I’m exhausted in the morning. 

The other weekend, I experienced some sexual abuse that has plunged me into an episode of some kind. I have been drugged and assaulted before (a few years ago) and that left a huge mark on me. The event that happened a few weeks ago feels like it reset my progress in dealing with the first trauma that I had. Anyway, I have had a hard time dealing with it and haven’t really been able to do much. 

My friend is mad at me because we have that class together. We are also in a club on campus together and she’s in charge of events this week that are really important to her. I’m trying to be a good friend and be there for her but she’s always mad if I don’t go to something and I’m having a hard time not feeling guilty. But even though I’m having a really hard time making it to class, I’m still going to her event for the club tonight. I’m genuinely trying to do at least one or two things that I can manage to do but I can’t do everything.

The youngest is a 6 month old boy and the oldest is a 3.5 year old girl. When I met them, **the mom was open about the boy having RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus)**, but I did not research it until now. I am afraid that this virus is highly contagious. I read that it can be contagious to up to four weeks and I feel shy to ask the mom when he contracted it because I don't want to be insulting. He wheezes and cries 24/7 and only has two toys to play with (a walker and a baby gym learning mat), which makes it hard to entertain him. The 3.5 year old complains every time I grab one of her toys and she is coddled by her mom so getting her to listen to instructions is a constant task. I normally wouldn't have a problem with this but maintaining both of them is a struggle. Every time the baby coughs or sneezes I am internally freaking out that I have contracted RSV because I've gotten sick already since the start of babysitting them.

I have seizure patients that take it but you need to take 4mg of folic acid (more than a regular prenatal) because there may be a link between lamotrigine and neural tube defects. We don’t know if it’s related to the pill or the epilepsy itself, but it’s a precaution because we can never really know. I don’t know about quetiapine, let me look that up in my book. OK, quetiapine is fine but you cannot breastfeed.”

PSYCH says: “I really don’t think it is OK. We can’t do any real studies so we just really don’t know. Lamotrigine carries the risk of cleft palates. Have you done your own research?

I’ve [22F] been recently struggling to end my relationship with my best friend [23F] of just over 2 years. We met at a college party and she helped me deal with the horrifying fallout with an ex roommate (also very much disturbed). 

*Background/Thin Ice*

In the period of time we’ve been friends, I’ve genuinely grown in my mental health , financial stability, &amp; academic scores. It hasn’t been easy especially given reconciling with my real disability and accepting my  diagnosis. I suffer with bipolar type 2, generalized anxiety &amp; ptsd that is heavily related to my leaving an abusive family early in college (19). 

My life experiences and struggles up to this day have instilled a deep respect and patience for healing and unlearning toxic behaviours we may have learned to survive. I’m not perfect and I am most definitely still undoing a lot of damage. 

My friend also has a somewhat similar degree of trauma and struggles with mental health. I have stood steadfast with her to points that are frankly unhealthy to me and backed up by my own therapist who suspected she may have been borderline. Last year she dropped out after severe depression &amp; returned to enrol in August.  

Shortly, since August a gross level of manipulation, carelessness &amp; indifference ensued. I agreed to let her stay in my tiny one bedroom until she found a place in town. She ran out of money, didn’t submit her visa to the point she was in the country illegally catatonic on a mattress on the floor all the time. Not actively looking to genuinely time share or care about the space. 

No amount of encouragement constructive or not even simple tasks to help with the depression would be met receptively. Chores would be less than half done or not done at all. I ended up doing and paying for most of the groceries and laundry. 

She would actively acknowledge that there was a difference between not being able to and not wanting to do things but choose not to do what needed to be done. Even simple reminders to do small chores would trigger a violent shift in mood, which I would later discover spiral to the point of suicidal gestures.

I don’t particularly remember how the episode started but she overdosed and started talking in her alter personality and I had to call 911. Several more gestures panic attacks fits and crisis centre visits I let her stay until December where the impact of her being in my home and her got to me to the point of leaving work because of how depressed I got. 

I was practically her mother the degree to which I would care for her. Feed her cook for her clean up after her pack her things unpack wake her up manage her meds etc etc etc

Now, 

I thought things would get better now that she finally has her own place but the distance hasn’t weakened the dynamic. In fact, she’s deliberately withheld picking up my keys from my neighbor’s after a long trip and found any excuse to have me over at her apartment even if I really planned, reminded her to grab the keys, so I  could rest at home. 

Two days ago we were supposed do groceries together but I ended up doing hers for her and commuting at least 2+ hours. It’s a vortex I keep getting sucked back in. This leads me to what’s really been the wibta bit. 

After the groceries I ended up meal prepping for her and crashing on her bed to the point where I was sleepy but already pooped from the commuted. I had a blanket covering me. I hear her talking on the phone about people, and then I slowly here her shit talking me and my boyfriend of a 1+years, ridiculing my dreams about a life and a family with him, saying how hard it is to be supportive of my “ugly” boyfriend, how things are going far to fast, how I liked an old crush that made me feel like shit more than I love my boyfriend who makes me feel cared for, beautiful &amp; safe, as well as how I’m a shit communicator— all while in the same room without regard for whether I’m actually asleep... she then tells the person on the phone “lol...is she even asleep [now checks] talked so much about her LOL!!”

I feel shocked, disappointed, disrespected and gross. I want to cut her out as harshly as possible but given that she is seeking treatment, but borderline isn’t something you can medicate straight away i wonder if I could even endure and be patient with anymore mess.",True,False,,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,95413,public,self,,,Help-I want to ghost my extremely borderline best friend (mention of her suicide attempt ),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/esov4u/helpi_want_to_ghost_my_extremely_borderline_best/,house_only,1

I started Latuda and other stuff in August after I was sent to the hospital in a manic episode. Since then, I finally started to feel normal again. However, I gained so much weight.

So, I went to my primary care and he told me there was nothing I can do about my weight. It is so hard because I eat moderately healthy for a college kid. (I cook a lot). I exercise 4 to 5 times a week on a regiment that's super good. And I'm sleeping at least 6 hours a night. And nothing is changing. My self loathing is at an all time high and I have to battle myself to take my meds because all of this happened because of them, but also because of this stupid illness. Sometimes, I just want to give up. I also consider eating disorders or pills to help maybe fix my problem, but I know that this is not the answer and my pills are working. My mental health should come first. It's so hard when you've always been the fat kid and you finally start looking good and then this comes along and you're back to being the fat one again. How am I supposed to get better if I can't look at myself in the mirror?

We love each other deeply and she’s aware of my bipolar and all that it entails. The beginning of our relationship was incredibly rocky, I had just gotten sober after years of alcohol abuse and at the same time I was diagnosed with bipolar and began medications. Needless to say, I was a dick. But she stuck through it. 

The problem I’m facing is not only managing my ups and downs, but the events of my past coming back and hurting us. It started initially when I failed to mention that I had had sex with an acquaintance of hers who she who she was interacting with due to her mutual friend groups. Similar situations like these would happen on occasion but the most recent one was I was discussing with a friend of hers, who too is bipolar, about the manic and unprotected sex I had before I met her. I’m clean, that’s not the issue. She’s explained that the issue isn’t the actions themselves, but the fact that she has to hear them through others. It doesn’t help that we went to college together and we have a lot of mutual friends. 

So the problem I’m facing is basically how do I explain to her that I’m not trying to hide anything from my past, but it’s just that there’s so much and it never occurs to me to bring it up. I love her, and she loves me, and we’re planning on getting married but she doesn’t want to be hearing about my past through the grape vine. At the same time I feel uncomfortable talking about everything I’ve done in my past before I cleaned myself up, it’s embarrassing and it isn’t who I am anymore. Do I just sit down with her and tell her everything, no matter how uncomfortable? What have you guys done?

About 6 months ago everything just kinda crashed down. My divorce was finalised, but I got a new job that I thought would help lift me up but instead just crushed me even further. I ended up just breaking down totally and having to take 4 months off from work (which thankfully I had the sick leave for). After that I came back 3 days a week to work, and work has been understanding and accommodating, but sometimes I just feel crushed when I wake up in the morning and I can't face the world at all. This happened yesterday and I just couldn't do anything. I couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't face calling work so I just switched off until I felt OK.

I got a call from my manager which I missed, then finally called him back and explained and he was understanding but obviously still somewhat annoyed.

I used to be fine with everything. Even on my crappy days I could still drag myself to work and make it through the day. I hate the feeling of being a fuck up, feeling like I'm letting my manager and team down. 

My meds are about 80% right, but still a bit off. I'm getting better over time but I'm scared I won't ever be back to not having those days of just being crushed and useless.

I'm grateful to them, tbh.

But bad thoughts doesn't really stop even after a few months of meds and therapy. There are days when I wanna reach out to people, just cry, and be stupid. The thing is, I'm very self-aware of my imperfections. However, on days that I feel somehow okay, I tend to be irritable of other people's flaws. I feel horrible about being impatient and frustrated at other people, when I know I can also be intolerable and toxic. I wanna talk to someone about it bc it's eating me up lately, but realized I have no one.

I tried talking to friend A. *seenzoned*
Friend B? He said it's good being self-aware, he also seen zoned me after I said I'm aware that I'm toxic and am having problems making friends. ((Sorry, while typing this, he replied that I gotta make new friends bc the field I'm in requires me to do so))
Friend C scares me now, because she previously liked a tweet that says smth like, ""you guys have never been the go to friend of people who breaks down, and it shows"". The post was about setting boundaries from toxic people (and I know that I'm her only friend who unloads toxic stuff to her.) I never talked to her abt my problems ever again after that.
Friend D might get tired of me soon bc I'm always saying that I wanna die.

So I was scrolling through messenger looking for someone I can trust who'll actually care and not bullshit me, and realized that I ran out of friends. I exhausted them all being the toxic shit that I am. I'm too tired to make new ones, and too scared of anyone new knowing all of me.

Hey all,

Since the beginning of 2018 my wife's BP2 fully triggered from a move (MD to GA) and its gotten quite difficult to handle, particularly this past year. Been married 8 years now and over time it seemed like something was wrong, but she never got diagnosed until December of '19 with BP2, BPD, and an eating disorder after being hospitalized back in October. First year of 2018 seemed like mostly a depressive episode for her with handling the move. Since February of '19 its been on/off episodes of depression and mania (particularly binge eating or hypersexuality). While its hard for me to see her suffer from both, I suppose its not so much a surprise that the hypersexuality is the one I struggle to handle with as her husband. I must admit I have not been a very supportive person because most of the time I thought it was out of selfishness, or something else, just not BP2/BPD which I'm beginning to understand is to an extent causes this erratic behavior. She started Lamotrine about a week ago and she's recently been on a manic episode and slept with someone else for the 10th time now. How does someone with a spouse who has this hypersexuality handle this (or maybe you don't/couldn't)? Or someone who suffers from this can give me insight that she hasn't yet or maybe is holding back because it does bother/hurt me even if I know its not out of maliciousness or personal.",True,False,,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,95468,public,self,,,Advice for a husband who's spouse has BP2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/esxud1/advice_for_a_husband_whos_spouse_has_bp2/,house_only,1

A bit hard to come on here to be honest but here goes:

Suffered from anxiety, OCD for a while and mainly veers around my health, relationships, religious stuff and worst-case scenarios. This mostly comes as intrusive thoughts, obsessions pure O at times and chest anxiety attacks (more slow release than hyperventilating etc).

I have been seeing a therapist for some months which has finally had some progress, but it runs out soon due to how my insurance works. I have to go to a physiatrist and get approval for more. You can probably see where this is going. 

After doing to tests and speaking to him for an hour, he hypothesised that I might have mixed affective state and wants to put me on a very low doses of Quetiapine (50mg) as a mood stabiliser for a week and bump to 100mg if there are not side effects and I'm better. He said it's caused by bipolar or a characteristic of it. 

If I'm honest I was in disbelief even if it's just a trial, he is testing out. No offense but I thought how this could be the case, surely my symptoms easily explain anxiety disorder and OCD.

I called them before I left and kept apologizing for worrying them and potentially ruining their vacation.

 I called my parents again today to let them know I'm okay now and that the images and smells and feelings from the flashbacks have gotten better. Which is more or less the truth. I no longer want to cut myself which is good. I didnt act on the cutting which is good. But I'm just worried about how much stress I put on my family. I again feel like a burden. 

But I feel like I can deal with these flashbacks now through journaling. The nurses said it has probably come on so strong since now I am 40 plus days sober from weed and am no longer using that crutch. Go figure. 
I suppose weed does help with PTSD by totally numbing it out. Now I have to do things the harder way. No drinking, no weed. Now I just smoke cigarettes and cigars on occasion. 

Just wanted to put the experience out there and let people know that if you are smoking weed for PTSD reasons, be careful. It has some drawbacks.

Essentially, I get mood swings every few weeks from highs to lows (further explanations on my profile in previous posts) but during my highs as of late, I’ve been having urges to be very reckless and destructive. This includes wanting to smoke, binge drink, go out at night/party, not do any of my college work, self harm and such. I haven’t done anything as of late, but have a history of self harm and have access to all of these things (I could do them without anyone finding out). 

Part of me hates the idea of all of these, yet part of me is intrigued by it. It’s as if I want to purposely do something I’m not supposed to, or get an adrenaline rush of doing something risky.

Any advice on what to do when I’m in these moods? I try drawing on my skin in place of self harm but it doesn’t give the same intensity of emotion I crave. But my rational mind (normal-low me) doesn’t want to do any of these things. Just in the moment I so desperately don’t want to care about anything other than that moment. 

On a side note, I’ve just been told by my GP today that there is no help (therapy or medication) until I turn 18 in 5 months due to no system wanting to take me in (both because of my age and because it’s ‘not severe enough’).

Anyway, my main question is about lamictal/lamotrigene. I was prescribed it almost a month ago but I haven’t started it yet, mostly out of fear. I don’t know what it will do to me mentally. I’m a very passionate person in regards to a lot of things and I don’t really want that to go away. I’m also scared of what will happen if I forget a dose or two or decide I want to stop taking it. 

I do want to stop falling into depressive states, and I’m getting more and more desperate to do that, so that’s why I’m here. I just don’t want to make a decision that’s irreversible, because I feel that once I start medicating I won’t be able to stop. Would anyone be willing to share their experiences with lamictal?

I recently got recommended the three medications (in title) and was wondering if there was anyone who has had experience with all three. 

Some background:

I started my mental health ""journey"" only around a year ago and my only experience with meds has been with Lexapro (for depression before my diagnosis was updated; hated it, gave me brain zaps and turned me into a zombie) and Hydroxizine HCl for general anxiety (which I'm still not sure really helps). 

I also used to self medicate with cannabis for the last 2 years but recently switched to cbd-only hemp since the weed started triggering manic/anxiety episodes around a month ago. Am not 100% clear on a diagnosis yet because I'm still in the process of trying to monitor symptoms as they come up but my psychatrist did mention possible bpd and bp2 and recommended the 3 above meds. 

Currently coming to terms with the fact that a mood disorder is manifesting and any experiences would be much appreciated! Tried looking it up in the sub but mainly got hits for Lithium and Lamictal and am hoping to hear from someone who's tried all 3.

I had a 1.5 week long manic episode this past December with lots of triggers around (mainly family) and was constantly hyper on no sleep, starting a new research project (never finished once I slipped back into depression), anxiety off the charts (throwing up almost every day, multiple times a day whenever I had an emotional trigger), and my period ended up lasting 21 days. It began around the beginning of the episode and seemed to be ending at a normal time (I usually have a 10 day period) but bleeding ramped up again after the 10-day mark, which led me to look at my period tracker app and saw that over the last 6 months the time in between my periods have been really irregular.

I don't think my periods are linked to the manic/depressive cycles (because of the irregularities don't match with the mood cycles) but was wondering if anyone has had any experience with the cycles affecting periods.

I don’t know tbh but my doctors have been going back and forth for about a year that I am or not. In the summer of 2018 I had a breakdown, it had been coming on but one day I couldn’t sleep for 2 days, I was severely suicidal and I overdosed on two bottles of Benadryl and ended up in the hospital. The next few months until September were a blur, constant insomnia and trying to be on my new Celexa. It was hard. I had episodes like this where I felt agitated, energetic, didn’t sleep, I was so energetic but I felt miserable, I felt so high but also so in pain. I can’t explain it. I had been having these episodes but to me it was just me being “weird” generally I was always depressed as a youth and my behavior kept getting worse as I got older. The most I didn’t sleep once were two days because my mind was racing and i felt like I was going insane. In September of 2018 I ended up getting 5150d and I can safely say going to the psych ward kept me alive and saved my life. When I got out I was still struggling but finally I got put on a high dose of Seroquel. It wasn’t a miracle but it really helped me. Now I’ve been on the same celexa, Ativan and seroquel for about a year and a half and I’ve been doing well. I’ve managed to get into school again, find a job and be relatively okay. I do many things like meditate and have a set bed schedule to keep me from “cracking” but my new doctor insists he thinks I’m bipolar two and he wants to add a mood stabilizer. According to him the seroquel is just a “bandaid” and I’m scared I’m so scared. I’m scared of cracking again I’m scared of losing all I’ve worked for. I’m just scared of going back to where I was in 2018. He wants to decrease my seroquel permanently and get me on a mood stabilizer.

Just thought I’d share my story in case someone out there can relate or just wants a read. 

I was recently diagnosed and it totally blind sided me. When the psychiatrist suggested bipolar I legitimately scoffed and said something to the effect of, “I don’t run around wearing make up!”

Man, was I ignorant.

A little background, I work in a profession that deals with a lot of trauma, chronic understaffing and high loads of stress. I am a high achiever with periods of “blah” I was previously diagnosed with PTSD and have been getting help with that for about 2.5 years. I was on escitalopram. Overall it helped for a bit, but I’d still collapse into a complete and dark depression.  But, I would get out of it and know I could get out of it and be a high achiever again. I just had to get over this next little bit and i would be “normal” again. 

So. I scoffed at this psychiatrist. Obviously he doesn’t know.  But I started looking into bipolar out of curiosity. I learned it was more than just being a spaz or someone who acted like a lunatic. All of a sudden things started to make sense. I always complained to people how I felt like I was an “all or nothing” kind of guy. The ups and downs. Those times people told me they weren’t sure which me was showing up that day. Why my anti depressants weren’t working....things lined up.

Then I doubted again. My rationalization: when I’m not depressed I can be on top of the world, I am the “chosen one” at work, I feel absolutely great, but I don’t over do it, i know my boundaries. I can light up an entire room with my energy and charm, I can work hard until 3 am and wake up at 6 am and repeat, I can be a super model...women want me, men want to be me. I can talk to anyone, I can do ALL the things. I am untouchable. But you know what? At the same time I am extremely irritable and get really frustrated. Surely someone who can be that high functioning can’t be going through a manic or hypomanic episode. Impossible.  Besides, I was irritable. That’s not something to be associated with a “high”. Right? This is just being a normal human with ups and downs, right!? 

Wrong.

Finally something registered. Yep. A lot of those things I associated with being great and normal behaviour actually end up with negative consequences. I’m impulsive, my decisions are quick and often irrational, I get in fights at work because I feel “untouchable” and I feel there will be no consequences to my actions. Working hard and doing EVERYTHING isn’t because I want to or because it’s expected, it’s because I HAVE to or else I’ll go stir crazy. I am not a super model. And yes, I can be on a high and be irritable just out of sheer energy. 

And then there’s the depression... Fuck, the psychiatrist was right. 

Now I’m really struggling what my normal is. I’m also struggling why no one said anything about my behaviours.

I'll try to keep the background info to a minimum but here we go. 

My older brother (27), was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago and his 20's have been an absolute shitshow. Growing up he was a popular, intelligent, charming and outgoing ladies man, and I always looked up to him. However at some point around age 19-20 everything went south. 

I was studying abroad when the first manic/psychotic episode happened. It occurred after he took adderall and he was hospitalized for a few days. My family had no idea what it was and kinda brushed it off. Afterwards he was completely depressed and a shell of his former self for nearly 2 years. He spent 80% of his time in bed. Like I said I was away for most of this time period so I couldn't really do anything from across the atlantic and my family was inept at helping him. At some point during this depression he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started on meds. What followed in the years since has been a series of time periods where he's himself, followed me mania where he gets extremely spiritual/religious and is a completely different version of himself (different personality, mannerisms) followed by a psychotic episode where he loses touch with reality, culminating in intense depression for a few months. Then he finally gains some momentum for a bit and then something happens and it all starts again.

To the best of my knowledge the triggers of his episodes have been: Adderall, Immense stress/displeasure with his occupation, LSD at a festival (horrible decision), tapering off meds because of side effects etc.

I love my brother more than anything and I feel like I'm the only one who can really connect to him when he's in these states. Every time he builds momentum it comes crashing down and it breaks my heart constantly thinking about what he goes through and the immense potential he had (has). During his most recent episode, he left home to the airport in the middle of the night and took a flight to israel with just the clothes on his back with the intention of moving there. He then had a psychotic break and we were luckily able to have family get him on a flight home which he promptly jumped out of when it landed and got arrested. Here's a [link](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/plane-passenger-opens-emergency-exit-14278616) (the article is BS he absolutely jumped out- airline trying to save face).

After months of immense anxiety and depression following the airplane fiasco he's finally been getting himself together over the last few weeks. He's been seeing a girl and has been working more (personal trainer/guitar lessons). Also he seems to have found a good balance with his meds as his side effects are finally manageable, although he's still waking up after 12 PM. I'm just very concerned that eventually he's going to relapse. He hasn't been stable for more than 12-18 months and whenever he had an episode the ramifications lasted 6-9 months (if not more) and completely reset his life.

I guess what I'm seeking here is a few things. Firstly, if anyone has anything general to share to provide comfort or advice please do! **Secondly and most importantly, I want to know if people who had a similar manifestation of bipolar as he had, were able to get it under control and live a normal life. If so, please provide insights as to how this can be done.** I just want to see him succeed and have a normal life/family. 

Lastly, I'm facing a crossroads in my life. I'm projected to begin law school next year and have thankfully gotten into some great schools around the country and I'm waiting to hear back from more. However, I'm very torn on leaving the NY area as I feel like if he does relapse I won't be able to live with myself if I'm not there for him. For whatever reason, when he's in a very desperate state I'm able to connect to him and really help keep him grounded- I don't think he has anyone else in his life who can be there for him in that manner. I just want to know that it is possible and likely that if he stays substance free and is consistent with his meds there's a strong possibility he can stay healthy and normal.

I just got diagnosed a year ago, and at first I was actually happy to receive a diagnosis. I thought that now that I knew exactly what was wrong with me, I could fix it. I have always been looking for a way to fix these parts of myself that \[I feel\] are separating me from normal relationship, socializing regularly, and just feeling as if I am blending in with the world around me. I thought educating myself on Bipolar, getting on proper medication, and making adjustments to my lifestyle would really help achieve all these things. But that's not really changing things in the way I thought it would. 

There are some parts of my life that are going significantly better with the medications and lifestyle changes compared to the past, and some of the symptoms of being Bipolar have gone away or decreased by a lot. But I still get very depressed and manically happy. I'm tired of the way I feel when I'm depressed and hopeless. I'm embarrassed looking back on what I did when I was manic. I still have this feeling that I'm not coming off as normal. It feels like when I was in a relationship, and I kept trying to make these adjustments to keep the relationship alive and well. But it just exhausted me. I felt like my efforts were for nothing. Like I was just trying to outrun the inevitable breakup. And that's exactly how I feel now.  Like I am putting in all this effort to keep myself healthy and stable, but I still find myself trying to outrun my own depression. And I just realized, I will probably always feel depression in this way, no matter what actions I take in my life. I will always be disappointed in my own irresponsibility and craziness when I'm manic, even though the actions I take when manic have died down. I just wish I had the option to stop trying so hard to keep myself stable, because I am frustrated with the problems of my life that still exist. I can't enjoy the happy moments as much because I know I will always have the bad moments, those will never go away. 

I really want to divorce my mental illness. I wish I had the option to pack up my things and move on without the burden of having to be this caretaker to my own brain for the REST OF MY LIFE. I just feel trapped with my malfunctioning mind and I didn't know if any other people who were diagnosed as Bipolar felt the same.

I've been on seroquel (quetiapine) and lamictal (lamotrigine) for just over 18 months now. My main drug is seroquel at 250mg augmented with lamictal 150mg.
I suffer mixed episodes, hypomania and major depression. Rapid cycling too but it's improved. Apparently the first-line drug is seroquel for my type of bipolar. But I just can't do it any more. My episodes, while shortened and seem to be less severe on the surface, seem like my brain is deteriorating faster with the atypical antipsychotic which unfortunately is to be expected. I will be titrating off the seroquel but continuing with lamictal. I'm seeing my psychiatrist soon to make sure it's a-okay.
Long story short, I'm obese and trying to lose weight, I'm getting some signs of prediabetes, I'm in a significant calorie deficit that I SHOULD be losing weight with but the seroquel is preventing it. Doesn't matter if I have 1000 calories or 3000 calories, it doesn't shift. I can't risk my overall health for mental stability.
So my question to mixed episoders (and bonus points if you're rapid cyclers) are any of you on lamictal monotherapy? Have you improved? Are you able to have some stability?

About a week ago I was prescribed seroquel to treat the possibility of bipolar disorder. I’m 28 years old, and have struggled with periods of extreme anxiety and paranoia, and on the flip side feelings of slight confidence and optimism. When I’m not anxious and freaking out about everything, it’s like I’m in a haze where my “reality” is skewed—I’ll feel like my life is going well but really it’s not. I start slipping up on my responsibilities, like taking good care of my pets. I also spend all my money, and lots of it too (I sold my house and spent the whole $70,000 I made in profit in 14 months). 

A little over a year ago I started taking antidepressants for my anxiety and stimulants for ADHD. Both seemed to work really well, too. I wasn’t as anxious at all, which was a life-saver. Concerta (for ADHD) actually made it so work wasn’t so damn hard. But I also started slipping up faster than I think I even realized. About 6 months ago, so 7 months into this treatment, shit really started getting bad without me realizing. My house was constantly dirty, I started forgetting to do tasks at work and not even bothering to care that they didn’t get done. I also started having thoughts like “I could murder someone and not care,” which is very much NOT normal for me. I’m in no way a harm to others (I watch a lot of true crime), but it was more that my normally uncontrollable empathy was pretty much non-existant. I was also suicidal, while at the same time overly hyperactive and bubbly at work.

Finally, about a month ago, I got super hyped up to help a friend move and crashed the next day. It’s like I realized how I had been living and was in a complete disassociation/derealization/depersonalization spell (my body felt foreign, I felt fabricated, I had very little sense of self). Once this happened, I didn’t sleep for 5 days, except for small naps here or there during the day. 

With the lack of sleep, I started getting a little delirious, like I would forget where I was and how I got there. Then the scary shit started happening—pictures on the wall would move slightly in my periphery, decals on dinner plates too, and I had an overwhelming feeling that if I even looked at any of the moving objects I would fall into a psychosis. My cousin was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was hospitalized, so I was on high alert. It was at this point that I called my psychiatrist and was switched to seroquel, while tapering off the antidepressant and stopping Concerta altogether for the time being. 




My question is if this narrative sounds anything like what others in the group have experienced? I feel like since I have quite terrible anxiety that it keeps me from falling into deep depressions. My psychiatrist isn’t 100% sold on a bipolar diagnosis for me, but just about everyone in my family (including my aunt who is a nurse) thinks I do. My family history is RIDDLED with bipolar disorder, just as a FYI. I just want to stop feeling like I’m alone in what I’m experiencing.

I have seen psychologists for years under the mental healthcare plans and have been on several antidepressants managed by GPs and it's not helping.

I tried telling my family i didnt want to go to Las Vegas with them.  They basically told me it would be extremely shitty if i didnt go since theyre paying for it all. So i agreed.  Im moving away in 2 months anyway.

Vegas is 3 hours behind my time zone.  We got here after riding in a car / plane for over 12 hours.  We finally got to my uncles house at 1am vegas time (4am home) ill be just stating Vegas time from here on


Anway there wasnt enough beds so i slept on the floor and got maybe 6 hours of sleep.  The next day came and went and vegas itself wasnt bad.  Then my family had their friends (and 2 kids) come over.


They all got drunk and high (i dont do drugs) and kept me up until 2am partying.  I couldnt fall asleep until 4am that night because my sleep rythm was seriously messed up.

The next morning my family woke me up at 7am because the whole house echos and they were laughing.

That day came and went.  i finally got a bed to myself that night and...i couldnt fall asleep until 4am.

Again family woke me up at 7:30 am from being loud.  I told them to knock it off because theyre seriously ruining my time here. They appologized  but i was already wide awake so i stayed up. 

Now its the night again, everyones passed out, ive been trying to sleep since 11pm and now its 2am and i can shut my brain off.  Im on the hard floor again...

I find myself completly regretting coming on this vacation.  The day time is fine. I have fun with them.  But i had an awesome routine i was in back at home and they basically destroied it by guilting me into coming

I'm not really clear what I'm trying to ask; probably just trying to get thoughts and frustrations out into the world.  


I'd been in counseling for a couple years, and my therapist suggested I go see a psychiatrist. Got diagnosed with bipolar 2 in October and have been on Lamotrigine 200 since November.   


I still have difficulty relating to the diagnosis. I've never had what would be considered any major manic episode, and I have a pretty functional life. I've kept every job I've ever had to 3+ years, I own my house, and I'm stably married. I do get super lows, usually 2-5 days a month where every aspect of my life gets internally criticized and more reason to hate myself.  


Part of me questions how much of these feelings are a completely normal response to this world. Why have I medicalized this experience of emptiness and dissatisfaction with a life that is often dissatisfying and empty?  


I'm struggling to see how this ever ends. Every appointment with the psychiatrist has either upped the medication, or added in another. Now starting Lithium, possibly moving to atypicals if that's not ""enough."" Will this be the rest of my life? How does one decide that they're well enough? If we're in the business of mood improvement, why stop there? Sure, I'd like some more energy and focus, throw in some ADD meds as well; sometimes I get performance anxiety, bring on the beta-blockers; and hell, I could use some performance enhancing drugs while we're at it.  


I understand that's hyperbolic, but it does feel like these are endless attempts to perfect the human experience. To characterize a condition as ""unbalanced chemicals"" seems unhelpful to me. Is it more likely that the life I have just doesn't fulfill my needs?   


I don't know where I'm sitting with this.

I've been seeing a counselor for a while, and in September they recommended seeing a psychiatrist as well. I went, and was diagnosed as bipolar 2 and put on Lamotrigine (titrating) and reached 200mg/day in October. Been on it since then.  


As background, I'm not really comfortable with the diagnosis. I haven't ever really had a manic episode, just dip into deep depression once or twice a month. I have kept every job I've had for 3+ years, I'm a homeowner and stably married. Most of the depression is focused on dissatisfaction with my life and not being able to pursue what I want. Then anger at myself for not working to alleviate that.  


I'm also uncomfortable with the medicalization of what seems to be a normal response to my life. It feels entirely natural to feel empty and dissatisfied with a life that is often dissatisfying and empty. I'm anxious about the present and future of the world because that feels like a normal response to a danger-filled and isolating environment. To try to characterize this reaction as a chemical imbalance seems dishonest and misguided.  


I'm nervous also about the medication. At a recent pdoc appointment, I was told I should add Lithium to further help with depressive episodes. In fact, every visit to them has either been a dosage increase or additional medication. Or a medication added to offset the side effects of the additional medication. What is the aim of this apparently endless tweaking? Of course I could feel better. I'd like to be able to have more concentration; should I be on an ADD medication?

Two of my friends recently revealed they are both bipolar, and there was a bit of a discussion about medication.

Its a long read, sorry guys.

So
I have had issues since a young age but ill summarise. 

Sexually abused as a child, by someone of the same age and gender as me but obviously more to it like i reckon she was getting abused etc etc else how would she have known certain things to do etc.
From about 10 onwards been under Camhs who diagnosed me with panic attacks and anxiety.
I.rarely attended school, had to sit at the back of the class else i was TERRRRIBLY anxious, shaky and fidgety etc and just walked out crying. 
Everyone put  it down to anxiety and panic attacks.
Then
Last January my doctor finally felt i should see  a psychiatrist- who diagnosed me with Bipolar and Panic attacks/anxiety.
I get months where im on a high, rarely panic attacks, not anxious, just living life,sexually active, shopping etc...then months of sadness anxiety cant even do things like walk down the road..i look a mess, just have 0 energy and go into a bit of a slump. 
Im on carbamazepine and sertraline.

I have so many worries and doubts like is it bipolar? Is it something more? Because im fine recently like my moods been good just randomly hormonal etc though, not even due on a period but just up and down a bit. Then today i go into a shop, come over all faint..dizzy...sweaty...light headed cant even speak properly and just need to get out asap. 
My eyes get all wide and just vacant and i feel like a zombie.
Is this normal with bipolar? Like why are my physical effects so bad!? Doctors just put it down to stress but i just wondered if anyone else has experienced the same thing as i am going out of my mind here.
I also have been suffering with severe pains in my stomach, nausea and just headaches CONSTANTLY. For months now, easily 6 months.

I've been struggling for a long time and, now that I'm 30, it's starting to strongly affect my every day life and how i process things.  I have always been neurotic, paranoid,  anxious,  and struggled with feelings of hopelessness and despair. I have also been an insomniac since childhood and would hallucinate at times of extreme sleep deprivation and stress,  and didn't respond well to SSRI'S  that I've taken in the past. I also had a traumatic and abusive upbringing, and recently began struggling with dizziness and vertigo. 


Despite having all these issues,  i have learned to cope with them and keep them inside.  Most people wouldn't think i had any type of issue at all.  But it was getting to be too much,  and i finally snapped in April due to extreme stress (brain aneurysm diagnosis, quit job of 12 years bc wasn't promoted,  and was sick due to mold exposure).


I was honestly surprised at my bipolar diagnosis. Since i wasn't expecting this and didn't know much about it, i thought that i was misdiagnosed.  I don't go through ""manic"" phases (spending money,  risky sex, extremely high energy, reckless behaviour). However,  after doing some reading it seems like i fall into the type 2 category.  My mania comes out as anger and irritability,  with severe depressive periods.  



I started taking lamictal a week ago and life is already so much better.  The ruminating thoughts stopped! I don't feel hopeless anymore.  I still get anxious but it doesn't hit as hard, and now my mind goes straight to finding solutions instead of lingering on negativity.  I do notice that now my anxiety comes out in physical ways more (shaking, tapping,  heart rate goes up) and my thoughts actually race much faster, but it's not as burdensome because it's not negative.  All the mental blocks i once had about even doing simple things (open mail, make phone calls, go out in public) are gone. Feeling so ""normal"" makes me realize how bad i was struggling all these years. 



As much as i feel better,  I'm also a little embarrassed and ashamed (not to offend anyone). There is such a negative stigma associated with bi-polar disorder.  I have always had troubles dating because i couldn't handle the emotional rollercoaster it would put me on, but i feel like I'm officially off the radar to many people now.  For example,  a friend i would talk to from time to time who has been very supportive of me in other ways(he is into me, I'm not into him)  completely ghosted me after i casually brought it up during conversation.  I have a feeling im going to get hurt a lot.

So i guess my question is... what are your experiences?  What should i expect?  Will things continue to get better?

The idea is often in the back of my head but I wouldn't bring it up with professionals or family members unless my desire to be hospitalized were greater than me desire to die, which it never is. It's so comforting to have people who I know I can tell anything and they'll respond with no reactive emotional support.

My friend P was my closest friend in recovery, then we both relapsed, we went to the same rehab, got into the same sober house and then went on a nasty run living out of his car using every kind of hard drug available in our region. I've never felt more in tune with the way another person thinks than I do with him. People in rehab told us we should do YouTube videos because we can go back and forth for hours switching off between jokes and serious, philosophical topics. There's a spark between us, there's no other way to explain it. Anyway we were shooting meth and heroin in his car for a couple weeks. I pulled out and went back to treatment (dropped out early but stayed sober) and I've only heard from him a few times via text since then (November). His phone has been shut off for a couple weeks. I can easily imagine that he just couldn't pay the bill and he'll come back around and make contact eventually, but  it's also too easy to imagine him all tense and twitchy in a heroin overdose, to remember holding my hand in front of his nose and mouth and not feeling any breath. I was only in the car for that shot by chance, I was supposed to be somewhere else but I couldn't get in so I turned back. I love him dearly and I'm left to guess whether he'll live to reach out again.

E has been the biggest emotional support for me for the past several years. When we first started hanging out she was in crisis. My role several times was to hang out with her all night so she wouldn't have to go to the hospital (or the implied alternative). Our friendship was balanced for a while but as I spiraled downward I came to rely on her a lot more, for support but also for more material things like a place to crash or food. She lost another good friend to suicide a couple years ago and blamed herself, and she was open about the fact that it made her really sensitive to my needs and where I was at. I wasn't trying to abuse that, but I fell back on her whenever my drug use got me kicked out of living situations. We ended up doing a bunch of cocaine and other stuff together for like a week and when she went back to her recovery community they warned her that she should stay away from me. They were probably right, but we were still in contact for a while. For a couple weeks now her phone just rings when I call. It's not turned off and I'm not blocked, she just doesn't answer. I can't hold it against her.

When suicidal ideation comes these days it usually passes within a few hours, before it percolates into intention and a solid plan, but I don't feel much control or mastery. That's just how it goes. If it didn't pass on its own I don't think I could force it out. Having allies who I can trust has been everything when it comes to pulling myself out of the abyss before it's too late.

Most of my focus is on malformations from scoliosis, my neck is hooked forward, I'm dis-proportioned (4in shorter than I should be, so my arms/legs are much longer than normal proportions), my ribs are uneven and stick out on my back like a hump on one side. I also have chronic pain, which keeps me from working &gt;30hr a week. Two weeks ago, a friend accidentally called me a freak, but didn't realize it. I was bullied for it for years and it brought it all back. I can mostly hide the Malformations, but people still notice. Every now and then, strangers walk up to me in public and ask about it, or try to touch my back. I don't get compliments on my appearance, so every time a stranger notices, it feels like they're proving me right.

When it comes to Bipolar, I get stuck thinking about my looks during depressive episodes. No amount of effort can ""fix"" how I look, and it makes it impossible to think of myself as attractive to anyone else. I know some people can look past that, but I feel like I don't have any qualities that really make up for it. That anyone open enough to accept me could do much better. Its been years since I've had anyone seriously interested in me, and that just makes me less confident, which makes me less charismatic, which makes me less attractive overall. It feels like I'm missing every single thing that someone looks for in a partner, all of my former relationships have been with addicts, making me feel like I've only had relationships because they were vulnerable and needed someone (anyone) for support.


If anyone has advice, I'd appreciate it. I know that people worse off have accepted themselves, but I haven't been able to beat this by myself. I can rationally realize that part of this is body dysmorphia, but when I look at myself, I just see the fact that every bone from hip to neck is bent/out of place.

Hi and thanks for any help you have.
Over the last two years, my roommate has turned from a friend to at times hostile and other times very miserable. We don't have a relationship anymore (she's had a lot of resentment toward me since I started dating someone and didn't spend the same amount of time with her) but when we were friends, we discussed her mental health very regularly. I've just recently noticed her mental health has been suffering, but I didn't notice it because I mistook it for her dislike towards me. 
What brought me to this realization was searching for missing dishes from our kitchen. A few months prior I had texted my roommate to please clean her pile of dishes that had been in the sink for a week and I was met with some nasty responses and the silent treatment for 2 months. So when all our dinner plates were slowly disappearing, I wanted to know if she had them before reaching out again. When her door was open one day, I peaked in her room to see if they were there, and I saw her entire living space was chaos. Clothes, makeup and cans all over the floor. Piles of dirty dishes next to her bed, and an overflowing bag of trash at the foot. Her bed was piled in papers and binders and open bags of food with food still inside. There was a tiny space cleared on her bed where she had slept among it all. It was very sobering, and made me realize the kind of dysfunction she had been coping through.
It's getting close to resigning our lease. Over the last two years, my roommate's negativity had made it miserable some days to be home, she doesn't clean anything, she still talks bad about me to our other roommate frequently, and her attitude makes it unpredictable and stressful to know what to expect. At the same time, she's clearly very much struggling. I was thinking what it would take for me to want to sign the lease again (we all have one year of school left and live in a city across the country from our families) and I realized I would ask her to (1) be at minimum cordial and not make the house hostile to live in, (2) I don't want to be hated in my own home, so stop talking bad about me to our other roommate, and (3) clean, so that the two of us are not picking up after three. If she'd be willing to do these three things I'd be willing to resign with her, but I don't even know if these are realistic expectations. I know I can't manage my roommate's mental health, but is it fair and reasonable to set these standards for how she reacts to us around her, even here at the lowest I've seen her experience?

That maybe I should focus on results, not the story. That would serve me better.

It’s like I am justifying myself in my mind and things seem reasonable. 

Except that maybe I am cheating myself whether people agree with my problems or not.

Maybe I’m not trying hard enough. 

And please don’t say things like “you are trying, you are brave blah blah.”

 You don’t know me.

But yea :( 

it is hard - trying and still failing 

or as i doubt it - “not trying and failing” is also hard

Also I feel like this illness with it’s struggles is something I have to go through myself. 

at least to some extent. maybe not when its too hard. 

and now im doubting myself again if i made this post to get sympathy. and - actually yes I did.

My current med cocktail is 
Lamictal- 100 mg in the morning and again before bed
Buspar- 10 mg in the morning and again before bed
Lexapro- 20 mg before bed 
Vraylar- 1.5 mg before bed


TLDR; I started Vraylar and have a lot of side effects. Is there something I need to be concerned about or is this all just the average for this medication?

I started Vraylar last Wednesday, Jan 15. Everything else stayed the same from prior. I was having ups and downs not attached to the holiday season and needed to stabilize more. The psych and I agreed since Lamictal makes me tired (non-functional exhausted) to try adding Vraylar. She gave me a month of samples and an appointment 4 weeks out.

I am in my own hell. 

It is currently 0115 CST and I woke up nearly an hour ago for no reason. And I can't get back to sleep.

I have had symptoms lined up with ADHD since I started Vraylar. I cannot sit still, I have heart palpitations all the time, I can't keep a line of thought and I can't finish even a simple project like washing my face or making dinner. I'm having visual hallucinations. The floor seems to flex as if breathing, the walls are not quite solid and appear to melt slightly and if I stare at the air it feels like a slow television static station in my field of vision. Text waves slightly in that same flex ad the floor. If I don't move during a conversation, I feel like I'm being slammed back at the start of a rollercoaster. My skin is uncomfortable, my joints hurt more than ever (although it is winter, which may explain that) and I have vertigo. I am having constant hot flashes. My normal oral and tympanic temperature is around 96.5 F. I am still at 96.5 orally and sitting in front of a fan feeling too hot to get comfortable. 

I can't stand myself. Are these common? Is there anything listed that should red flag and be an immediate go to the doctor? Or do I keep trying and see if this improves?

Everyone will say 'avoid alcohol, it only makes things worse' like it's some universal truth, however after long talks with my psych, my gp and pharmacist we're of the decision that I'm fine to continue drinking. 

Let me put it into perspective, while before I was diagnosed it wasn't an occasional drink, I was putting away litres of spirits a week and gallons of beer or cider, I used to drink a LOT alcohol helped me with my insomnia and it certainly helped with the pain, so I was definitely self medicating with it.

However, now I will have a couple of drinks a week, and it's never to relax or help with pain/sleep. It's purely because I enjoy a beer or GnT. It's a treat, but not because it's alcoholic but because I generally don't like soft drinks, especially now they have brought in the sugar tax in the UK. My choice is basically coffee, beer or water in the evenings, and whilst it's mostly water my beer is just that little enjoyment I let myself have.

I also talked at length with my psych about whether alcohol affects my drug routine, and his opinion is that it really won't.

Hi Friends. My sister has had a psychotic break about 3 weeks ago. She thinks she is the reason trump is being impeached, that she’s behind the uprising in India, and that Russian Spies are out to get her. I suspect Bipolar 1 w/ delusions triggered by stress (she had just started a new job, which she was promptly fired from). 

Problem is, she thinks she’s totally fine. Gets extremely hurt when people don’t believe her and threatens to cut us all out, which she did for a terrifying 4 day period during which she drove 3 states away and appeared at my door step on the other side of the country with no car anymore (abandoned the car and flew.) she refuses treatment, and the mere mention of it right now is enough to almost loose her to ya entirely. She does not seem to be an immediate or clear danger to others- and not her self (not suicidal or anything, and has periods of total lucidity.) But she has said she chased spies o the highway for a while flipping them the bird. Not sure if this actually happened or not, or how dangerous it was, but doesn’t sound good either way. Curiously, when she said this she said “I know this sounds crazy but...”

Any advice on how to keep her safe, get her treatment? She also has periods where she thinks she’s a billionaire and is spending money like it too (tipped a server $100 yesterday.) she’s crashing with me for the time being, but can’t stay here forever (i have housemates).

She stays in my room with me so that I can explain to her that she was asleep and explain what parts are delusion and what parts are real. Last night she was waking up every 15 minutes to 45 minutes at the longest. Each time never knowing that she was asleep and thinking the dream was really what happened. 

She also sometimes starts dreaming the moment her eyes are closed. She has woken herself back up because she started talking to someone in her dream not realizing she was already falling asleep.

Last week I was prescribed lithium since my other meds weren't quite doing the job. The first day I took 300mg, second day I took 600mg and the last two days I've been taking 900mg.

When I wake up I feel quite dizzy and disoriented and I was just wondering if this was normal and if it will go away. I always take it with food so that's not the problem with the vomiting.

medication and therapy has done wonders, that i can’t even believe. it was hard to notice at first, but recently my therapist talked to me about how far i’ve come, and that people can notice. she said, even the receptionist has said to her, “i’m amazed by how much better this girl is doing within a year.” 

it’s still hard, but i’m trying to work through it. living a life of suffering up until this point and learning how to be a new, mentally stable person has proven to be exceptionally hard, and as strange as it sounds, i often do “miss” the feeling of being deeply deeply depressed, even though it’s almost killed me countless times. maybe it’s because that’s what was familiar for so long? who knows. 

there are still times when i loose control, even when i am taking my meds. last summer, i went to a festival and went way too hard with the drugs and alcohol, and had an accident where i feel out of a rooftop car tent onto my head and nearly died. 

but i guess the point of this post is, if you’re struggling to find hope, if you’re struggling to keep up with your meds (you know most of us do at some point), or if feel like you can’t get help or understanding anywhere, don’t give up. i know it’s so fucking hard, but you CAN get through this. and you have no idea how STRONG you are.

having bi polar is such a roller coaster of an experience that most people will NEVER go through, and it takes a STRONG ASS PERSON to deal with that!!

The issues finally got fixed less than a month ago. While I was still suffering from crazy pain, I was diagnosed with ADHD. The pain / mental fatigue / stress from the teeth issues made it hard to understand what was going on in my mind.   

I was talking about hyper-focus with my brother and mentioned it lasts for several days and he gave me a strange look. Apparently ADHD hyper-focus lasts hours, not weeks. After discussing several things with my psychiatrist, I now have an unspecified Bipolar diagnosis.   

I didn't think I had bipolar because I never felt like I had manic episodes. I didn't understand it could mean irritation instead of happiness. It was overwhelming to learn that ADHD affected me so greatly, and throwing bipolar disorder on top of it is very hard to handle.   

I'm thankful that I know now, because it explains quite a lot. At the same time, I feel like my entire life up until this point has been a waste. I hated being so emotional, which is especially hard for a guy to deal with. It also doesn't help that I dealt with a lot of abuse growing up.   

I'm stuck between feeling deep sadness about how this has affected my life, and anger and resentment for the way so many people have criticized and belittled me. The worst part is not knowing how much of those feelings are how I 'really' feel.   

I've already started taking new meds, and I'm looking forward to seeing improvements. I've also been exercising, trying to eat better, attending therapy, etc. I'm not going to hang around where I am now because I know where I want to be and I'm taking steps to get there. I haven't found any support groups in my area yet, but I hope I do.

Obviously I'm bi polar. But I also deal with anxiety, and adult ADHD. My mental health is beyond terrible. I do a lot to combat it though. Therapies, and prescription drugs help. I excersice daily, and make sure I'm always around friends. ( I have the best support from my friends, I don't have enough words to describe how amazing they are towards my mental health ) But even being pro active and trying to fix it doesn't mean that I'm ever going to be ""good"". 

I havent been in a relationship in about 7 years and it's because I'm so scared to put someone into a position where they have to deal with these issues. I'm generally ok and can be happy on my own, but once in a while i start to feel empty. I go on dates, and have one night stands when needed but it doesn't fill the hole. 

My constitution is very good. I feel as though I could easily live life without a romantic partner. I just hate how much my mental health hurts people around me. Iv seen it before, and sometimes makes me toxic depending on my mood. 

So simple question, should I try to be with someone? Or is it just selfish to put someone else in that position ? Do I deserve to have someone In my life?

I was diagnosed with type II Bipolar disorder.

This was a few months after taking care of my Mom who was diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer. She is healthy and in remission now, but previous to her diagnosis, I realized her behavior growing up was... less than ideal. She is basically text book BPD and a Narcissist.

I've dealt with PTSD most of my life after witnessing her be assaulted by my uncle when I was 4. My mental health problems quickly started after that. I first attempted suicide at age 7, and dealt with suicidal ideation for years until I was 13 and diagnosed and started anti-depressants.

My Mother handled my problems by outright ignoring or making me feel guilt about them. The most memorable examples being when I confessed to my family at 13 that I was suicidal, and I was basically berated for inconveniencing my family with my emotional problems. I also around that time was inappropriately groped at a football game by one of my Mother's friends. My mother's response to this was to stop taking me to the football games with her.

She also regularly drank a bottle of wine a day or more, and at one point started seeing the same therapist as me and would schedule her appointments before mine -- go over her time into mine, and tell him all the ways I was ""acting out"" that week. This lead to me not being able to deal with my PTSD issues.

My only coping mechanisms became art and my cat Ollie.

After my manic episode, my previous therapist recommended I do DBT. I started last June, and at first really liked the practicality of the skills, but my mental state has slowly deteriorated.

My previous therapist had me diagnosed with BPD, which I was initially against the diagnosis as I did not want to be associated with my mother in any way. However after time I decided to try to be more open minded, and ask about the diagnosis and if we could go over it since although I could see some of the criteria making sense, felt the majority of it didn't fit me and wanted a better explanation of how I fit in and why that diagnosis made more sense over Bipolar and PTSD. I was more or less told to ""Not worry about the label"", but felt I had a right to know what I was dealing with. We kept butting heads, so I ended up switching to a therapist at the place where I do DBT.

I had to put Ollie down in October suddenly and unexpectedly at 13.

He was my best friend. And I feel like part of my heart has died. People will say he was just a cat, but he saved me from killing myself on more than one occasion and I loved him more than anything.

My psychiatrist raised my depakote about 2-3 months back now, and due to her not sending in the dosage change to Walgreens, I ran out of my meds over a weekend and went into a manic episode.

She also recently tried me on wellbutrin which similarly made me mixed to manic, and I had to stop taking it. Both my psychiatrist and therapist now seem to agree that I'm dealing with type II Bipolar disorder. Whether or not BPD or C-PTSD is playing a part in all this is still undetermined.

I have not been able to talk about any of this the last year.

DBT (at least from my experience) is only skills focused, and because of the BPD label being in my chart from my previous therapist, anytime I'm feeling depressed or grief or for a fleeting moment maybe even feeling ok, it's brushed off as just ""mood"" related, and I'm told to focus on skills.

I'm tired of every time I'm upset it gets treated like it's not real and I'll get over it if I hold an ice cube or take a shower, or just think other thoughts. Or if I dare to try to be positive one week, and have the strength to try to hold my head up higher than usual, it's a sign that I'm clearly fine, and all this sadness and depression is coming out of nowhere.

Like no, all this trauma and sadness and grief is still there, it's just sometimes I'm better at being able to present like it's not bothering me.

And it's always met with the same response. Use skills.

I don't know how to use skills for this. Knowing how to ground myself when I'm nervous is all well and good, but I'm a person. How am I supposed to move on with my ""life vision"" when I have this barrel of shit I'm dragging around and nobody allowing me to process it?

I have dealt with so much trauma, and I'm losing my faith in psychology. Lately I just feel like I'm having my insurance billed for nothing, while I sit in a group of people who are so goddamn intense while we all draw turkeys ""mindfully"".

I had to take Ollie off of my safety plan recently. I came home from that session and cried harder than I ever have in my life. I couldn't breathe, my heart felt like it was being pulled apart.

I have never felt more empty, unheard, un-cared for, and just plain hurt.

I have been taking lamotrigine for a little bit under a year and it has helped tremendously. Obviously it’s not perfect, but up until these past few days I rarely have any issues.

These past few days have been a little whack, so I’ll give you TLDR:

1.) Didn’t get any sleep on Friday night.
2.) Worked 10 hours the next day
3.)Got 2 hours of sleep Saturday night.
4.) Worked another 10 hour shift.
5.) Currently Sunday night, still not feeling tired.

Has anyone who has taken lamotrigine experienced this while on the medication?

I was the best and most ""me"" I'd been in a long time.
That is until a few months ago. I was mostly having depressive symptoms with spikes of hypomania. Recently, I've felt more anxious and paranoid than ever and have been spiralling on extreme and unlikely scenarios. I've had an increase in suicidal and self harm thoughts and even cut a few times. There is a new P.Doc in my small town and he wanted to wait until after christmas to see me again and see if I improved. I've had increasingly worse symptoms.
This brings me to last weekend. I had a night out with my husband and friends. Ended up drinking to much as usual. I've been experiencing worse effects from alcohol lately- overly sexual, spikes of energy, meltdowns, no verbal filter and black outs. My plan was to only have a couple but of course i didn't stick to it. I felt so ill all of Saturday and am still feeling nausea now (monday). My bright idea was to smoke a little weed to settle my stomach and hopefully give me an appetite and much need calm. I use weed every now and then for calming but am not a chronic user. My plan was to have a few puffs and go to bed. It seems i had a lot too fast or it possibly interacted with any alcohol still in my system... either way I ended up experiencing the most frightening symptoms I've ever had.
I felt overheated so lay in the bath with cold water from the shower spraying me. I started hyperventilating, my heart was racing and I was convinced i was dying. My husband came into the bathroom and tried to calm me down. I kept asking to see a Dr or for him to punch me out. I threatened to kill myself. I went through about 10 things I was dying of and then reasoned I was already dead- it was just my body left. I thought my guts were bursting out my stomach then wanted to rip them out. I told my husband I would bite his tattoo off his arm. He pulled me out of the bath and i fought him, bit his shirt and started screaming. I ground my teeth, bit my lip, spaced out and then talked in circles and repeating things like ""I'm dead, I'm dead"". I kept begging to die.  He hid all my meds then went to calm down our kids who at this point had heard me screaming and started freaking out. He was terrified and about to get his brother to come help when he realised valium might help. He quickly googled for interactions and if it would be helpful and then got me to calm down enough to take one. When it kicked in and the adrenaline started to drop he put me in bed and I calmed down enough to hug my kids, say goodnight and apologies for scaring them. I explained I felt really sick and was really scared but am ok now. They seem ok now, I've talked to them again about it (but not bipolar). My husband was shaken and is worried but says he doesn't hold anything I said against me. I said some truly awful and disgusting things to him, i still can't believe what came out of my mouth.
I'm seeing my case worker tomorrow and hopefully she can get me into the P.doc. I feel like I'm at rock bottom- don't want to even look at alchohol and scared of weed now. My consumption of both has increased with my decline and also contributed to it I'm sure. 
I'm just absolutely terrified of this happening again and putting my family through it again.

During her psychotic episode she sexted and online friend from another country and on the day of her psychotic break she was found drunk in a bar talking to a guy (but nothing happened) and she kept him on instagram.

Now, I'm doing all I can for this woman I love and she seems to care for me greatly some days and not at all on others. Is it normal?

While I am not diagnosed as being bipolar I’m having some fears that I might be. Backstory, bipolar runs on my paternal side of the family. My father as well as his siblings and some of my cousins have all been diagnosed. Last year I went through some pretty stressful situations. I was put on celexa in early April and found myself spending ALL the money I had saved prior to my (at the time)  husbands top surgery. 
I would say it’s highly out of characters but it’s been a continuous pattern in my life where I do really well with saving and prioritizing then I don’t remember much after feeling on cloud nine spending money left and right. Then after I hit terrible lows that are hard to pull out of. Then I feel okay for a few weeks and then it cycles back through. I left my abusive marriage two weeks after my husband and had top surgery. While I’ve always wanted to leave the day I did I was buzzing with energy and had asked him for an open relationship (something we’ve discussed since we married as a lesbian couple)  I don’t regret it but I feel like I make tons on impulsive decisions. Also at times when everything is too much and i start to feel myself slip I hear things I can’t really tell if they are there or not and experience people always watching me and following me wherever I go. If anyone could offer any advice or resources that would be so great. I recently lost my insurance because my ex and I split and I’m also taking on his surgery payments and that he refuses to pay so I can get help. Things are getting really difficult to work through. Thankfully I have a partner who is diagnosed bipolar and she’s helped me in ways but I know I need way more than just that.

At another point in my life. This time I am fighting to stay in it, fighting the impulses to just cancel appointments or not go. Trying to talk myself out of taking my medication. But, I still take it. When they put me on SSRIs I did as I was told, despite the fact I said I thought it would trigger a manic episode (it did).

General diagnosis of bipolar and emotionally unstable personality currently 
Quetiapine was started. Increased. Increases some more. Currently on 400mg a day. 
I can hear things. Which is new, I think. Sometimes I'm sure I can hear a CPU processing, but I'm outside and it's silent. It's like it's inside my head. It's like the sound of a floppy disk or cd being read. Old school. 

We've all agreed quetiapine isn't working. Ive gained 10kgs since November. I'd lost 28kgs between January and November. Shit way to end the year, putting weight back on again. 

So options given are aripiprazole or Amisulpride. Nobody I'm close to seems to want to discuss it. They've Googled it and seen that its for schizophrenia and now it's like everyone is scared of the person who needs those sort of drugs. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. 

I think Amisulpride is what I'll try. For all the wrong reasons. Side effects of elevated prolactin and I already have low calcium, so more likely to get physically ill which I feel I deserve.... I suppose I should probably tell someone that I feel that way. But I don't know how. 

Every time I go to talk to someone or even type something I just feel scared that it's too much for them to handle or want to listen to and I just stop. I'm just keeping it all inside. I was supposed to be getting therapy but no therapy has appeared. 

Maybe this will help. I don't know.

So I found an old sd card from ex and it has a weird root directory with some strange files and formatting doesn't rid them. Once kept in for weeks random video files I can't see would pop up
And like 1000 other files I can't delete or anything 
But format...and in time...I accidentally found that sd card today and I was explaining that it was set up for a phone my ex had rooted but he doesn't believe a word I say
Most people wouldn't 
Because it didn't happen to them 
Because it sounds like psychosis...but I used to have the proof. I had to change everything after I left. Because it gets under my skin.

I know a lot of us get up and go to work or school. I know some of us are raising kids, are in relationships, and are considered overall functioning members of society. But being bipolar is hard. Extremely hard. It’s harder for us to live life. And while that’s not an excuse to receive special treatment, it does make us stronger than some. 

In my case I can live a somewhat normal life. However as soon as my depressive and manic episodes seep in I realize how challenging it can really be. 

I’m bipolar 1 and have been for a very long time. For me it’s waking up one day and feeling absolutely horrible. Drained, hopeless, stressed, and dread for the day ahead. Then maybe 3 hours later, a day later, maybe even a week later I’m all of sudden on top of the world. I feel like I bring more to the table than anyone else around me.  Then boom! Back to the depressive state. And it’s a constant cycle. 

It’s almost like coming down from a drug. You get that rush of “feel” good in your brain but once it’s gone it drains all of it out of you. And you’re left wanting more to reach that state of contentment again. 

But what do we do? We can medicate, pursue healthier diets, exercise, etc.. but as much as the can IMPROVE our struggles it will never completely abolish them. 

So I’m going to try and live for the good moments. The times where I feel okay. Being bipolar is hard, but my willingness to adapt to my own feelings might get me far.  I’ve recently been struggling with extremely poor coping methods and am looking for some potential advice/conversation regarding being bipolar.

I’m looking for some guidance. I’m a 30-year-old female. I’ve dealt with eating disorders since I was 10, and depression/anxiety since I was 14. I also grew up in a very volatile home with an NOD/PTSD father. 

Up until I was probably in my mid-20s, though, I only had what were depressive episodes but no periods of mania. Once the episode went away, I felt neutral. Something shifted at 25-26. I started experiencing depressive episodes, but some months I felt “high,” like a bubbling energy. That’s also the time I had an abortion. Not sure if that triggered  anything for me. I also went through a breakup. 

I had what felt like a month long depressive episode this time; no energy, not talking much, no motivation; eating disorder kicks in. Three days ago, it’s like I suddenly shifted. I need less sleep and feel rested. I did some heavy work outs and I felt great - so great I was still able to go for a job, visit family, and clean the entire house. I also talk A LOT MORE. My thoughts deel all over the place, but this is when I’m best at my job. And there’s a sense of euphoria. Honestly, I love having these states. I have these manic-like episodes less than once a month, though. Not sure how often the mania has to be for it to be bipolar. 

I’m already in therapy for “depression,” but what worries me is that there’s more to it. I’m not on any kind of meds, btw.

depth perception

the terracotta tile swims under my feet, brushing softly until it kisses the coffee colored walls- whispering secrets of all mankind, the silence reverberating in my eardrums. bamboo with hearts, aliferous in metaphor, etched into the trunks come into my peripheral, and i remember. i remember a time of faith and love sickness, before. before the hiraeth took over my soul and i felt the aching sensation of lungs full of pressure.

i sit.

the delusions of happiness and grandeur that once burdened me, now leaving me empty and anemic of true feeling. emotions were apprehensive, now turned to dust. kalopsia, and i knew it to be so. to palter with life is to play with death- such a game it shall have seemed to someone knowing so much and yet so little about the universe. incarcerated in an empty house, with empty memories staining its livelihood: a livelihood had and now lost in the tales and woes of regret and apprehension.

i stand.

treacherous steps through the foyer, out of the threshold of safety and onto the sand, burning white and tingly beneath my feet. what a sight to see- a marcid girl in a stream of white silk, all done up with nowhere which to return. what was once a vernorexic atmosphere is a cloudy, withered shell of what was, never to come back henceforth. 

i step.

i step once more.

and i step again until i reach the water.

crystal waves lapping at my ankles, stinging at the abrasions put carelessly from broken glass and brokenness. the salt is a tristful smell, full of longing and promises of the past coming to close with the future, and i- the object of the emotional energy- take a step deeper into the waves. once a nefelibata, now a dying rose. the dress of white silk becomes heavy around my calves, like chains threatening harm. is it harm? or is it peace.

i step further.

the spoon drift hits my face and the salt settles into my soul, cleansing and washing to the dirtiest degree. up to my waist now, a cloud of ivory flowing up around me, at mercy to the sea and her mysteries. charmolypi slices through my heart, my wrists, my veins, my pulse, just as the saltwater reaches my neck. a sense of akrasia, and my body takes over. i feel the heavy, airy fabric, i feel the salt, i feel the freedom, and the cacoethes defeats me, and i’m sinking. i open my eyes and drift away, into smaragdine tides and worlds i’ve never known. i disappear into the pitch black nothingness- never to return again to the house of terracotta tiles, whispering to coffee colored walls about disparaging secrets that shall no longer be heard by myself.",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,95181,public,self,,,depth perception- the best thing i've ever written,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/erkzil/depth_perception_the_best_thing_ive_ever_written/,house_only,1

Tonight I've just been really unforgiving to my boyfriend and I should feel terrible, but part of me also doesn't care. I got mad he waited too long to read my text which meant I had to walk home in the snow instead of him picking me up. I made a face when he made a really gross snack (he knew it was gross, I thought we were all on the same page) and said it smelled disgusting as it microwaved and he got very upset and asked why I'm always so mean to him. And because I'm the fucking worst and can't actually apologise, I just wordlessly hugged him until he told me to leave if I was just going to say rude things so I went to bed and depression knocked me out for a bit.

He came back when he was done with his food to wake me up and apologise for yelling at me and to cuddle. Now, I was legitimately still mostly asleep at this point and ended up saying he isn't as fun as he used to be. He was very hurt and kept asking me if I meant it, but my head was so strangely empty and I was still really tired and my body just sort of... shut down. So I ended up lying there passively holding my boyfriend while he cried until he fell asleep.

The whole time I just... didn't care, really. Part of me was screaming at myself to properly wake myself up and apologise and tell him I love him, etc. The other part genuinely didn't and doesn't give a fuck.

Got up to get some pity ice cream and saw that when I asked him to buy salad greens earlier he bought frozen spinach, now I'm furious all over again.

I want him to wake up so I can apologise and try to make it better but I'm scared I'll just end up lashing out or making him feel worse. This is so unfair to him. He does so much for me and has seen me through so much shit. He's got his own problems and doesn't need a girlfriend who makes a big deal out of nonexistent problems to try and put him down.

I do not suffer from the nonstop energy but I am very impulsive, I partake in high risk situations, I spent $700 just out of nowhere on what I don't really know, random shit and I am constantly out of budget or spending over my budget. I also suffer from hyper-sexuality - I seek out sex for the rush for the feeling. My brain feels like its constantly at war with itself, I am constantly thinking and on edge, my brain wont shut off it only ""chills"" out when I am down or in a depressed state.

I went to my psychiatrist and told her my thoughts, my concerns ... she basically told me I was too functional to be bipolar. She said ""we don't see people with bipolar hold steady jobs or the type of job you have"" (i am a nurse) ... she was just so persistent on that fact that I was so functional.

So basically she just said it was my ADD that is severely uncontrolled. So trying Wellbutrin along with Lexapro and going back in a month.

If my symptoms are still the same she better listen to me more.

My husband, had to watch his new wife cry herself to sleep every night for a year over a guy (it was platonic but hit me really hard). I felt like shit. I was a newlywed and was crying over some other male. 

A year later I found out I was pregnant. Over the moon, we actually found out a few days before our first anniversary. This was my first and only pregnancy. Of course, we ended up losing the baby. I had to have emergency surgery because my ob was concerned I was hemorrhaging. They discovered my baby had been dead for weeks but my body didnt realize it.

I’ve had a complete breakdown and I know that all this trauma has changed me. 

I was recently diagnosed with bipolar. I was put on Lamictal and was showing signs of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. I’m recovering from that still. My psychiatrist wants me to try Abilify but she isn’t too smart and completely fucked up my prescription which ended up delaying me getting my medication and here I am now two weeks off meds and nobody cares.

If it weren’t for PHP, I probably would not leave my house for days. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. I have to start ECT soon bc nothing will treat it.  

I’m also a Catholic. I KNOW I need to go to Mass. I know that I feel better afterwards. But the act of getting up, shaving, getting dressed, eating, going, sitting there, it’s like trying to climb the tallest, steepest peak. It’s like pulling teeth with no anesthesia. I don’t know why!!! And I’m dreading Mass tomorrow. I really don’t want to go. I feel physically ill, but I know it’s not contagious, just my body reacting to my mind.  

Does anyone have any coping skills, anything to help me? I’m at a point where I can’t just show up. I know it’s good for me to work on my spiritual health, I know that it’ll help me, but I don’t!!! Want!!! To!!! Go!!!",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,95043,public,self,,,I don’t want to go to Mass,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/eqqy03/i_dont_want_to_go_to_mass/,house_only,1

It also sucks to not be able to afford group therapy! Share your experiences with free support groups from whatever perspective of recovery.

I've been going to two, with a generally positive experience. My experience so far is that it's lovely to have a support group at all; that's about 80% of the benefit. The details of the remaining 20% vary.

1) Emotions Anonymous is a recovery group modified from traditional 12 Step recovery programs like AA or NA. I've been going about once a week for about a year, now. The only requirement to join is a ""desire to become better emotionally."" It's very diagnosis-agnostic, so there are a diversity of psychological geogrpahy. Most of the people I meet there are bipolar, BPD, or suffering from PTSD, with a couple of DID cases. Meetings are supposed to be safe sharing spaces, meaning no unasked advice or commentary on others sharing. I'd say the major benefit other than a sharing space is the anonymity. The structure of the 12 steps might help some people and might frustrate others. The major con, to me, is the higher power stuff.

https://emotionsanonymous.org/

2) The Icarus Project is a mutual-aid network and support system for people dealing with Mental Health Challenges that normally get called mental illness. I've attended about three meetings in my lifetime. Groups are organized autonomously and non-heriarchically, and groups provide a variety of functions. It is implicitly anarchist, and as such a lot of the literature it offers links mental health policy to repressive political apparati like the prison system. The major thing I like about Icarus is that it is harm reductive and self determinative regarding diagnosis, medication, and treatment options. The hardest part of making the groups happen is that it's hard to get political activists interested in mental health and it's hard to get emotionally debilitated people interested into politics.

https://theicarusproject.net/

Oh, and Icarus has tons and tons of really good resources though, including a 1 page handout of crisis advice and space to write an advance directive. I highly recommend that anyone with BPD fill out a 1 page sheet on your needs during a crisis rather than let random medical professionals guess at your needs and preferences.

I've been extremely depressed for a while now, and I'm completely alone. I have no friends. I've spent the last year trying to make friends with no avail. At the same time, people say really nice things about me, so it isn't that. Yet no one wants to be my friend. I feel very alone. It's a problem because I don't have support during this.

All my old friends weren't really friends, and they are the reason I have post-traumatic stress disorder. They've been acting really volatile and I'm afraid of them threatening and harassing me again, and it's a credible threat, even though I've completely isolated myself from them. This isn't something that's mind over matter, since with PTSD, cues will trigger extreme responses. So it isn't something that, like other things, you can problem solve and feel better.

At the same time that this is happening, I see a therapist on campus at school. I can't go anywhere else for insurance reasons. I do have a great therapist who helps me, but the therapist I had before him abused me in therapy. He sexually harassed me and told me to kill myself (which was why I switched). I've filed a complaint with the licensing board but that is a long process. I filed a complaint with the school first. I thought they had fired him but now he is back a year later, and the University is not following through on their promise I would never encounter him again. This overlapped with PTSD events. I cannot see him without having a panic attack. And the University is not following through even though I have my department on my side. The counseling center just isn't cooperating nor is the university admin, despite their initial promises and despite this violating the ADA. There is a very good chance I'm going to have to take the University to court, because as I said, I don't have other therapy options, need therapy, and they won't budge. 

Yes I could take the other people to court too if they start harassing me again but going to court over either of these things is an absolutely, god awful, terrible fucking thing that will be traumatic and is not something that gives me comfort. Saying I don't deserve this or that it's wrong or illegal doesn't matter because they're doing it anyways.

And on top of this, I found out I'm sick  and need surgery. Probably will need two.

This happened on top of me being already very depressed. The problems these touch on have been going on for almost two years. I've tried virtually every medication there is. I can't afford ECT or TMS, and the side effects of ECT would actually probably mean I wouldn't be able to pursue my career anymore because of what I am studying to do (it is viable for other people but not me). But I can't afford it anyways. Ditto for outpatient therapy, though I did initially try it once before it turned out my insurance wouldn't cover it, and it very much was not something I would benefit from. But again, I can't afford it.

I'm doing everything right. I don't drink. I don't do drugs. I exercise every day. I go to therapy. Im compliant with medication. I've been deeply invested in personal development. I used to give back a lot to the community. I do work on top of school that makes a difference in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

None of it is enough and things are getting worse, not better, and I've learned in therapy that this isn't me. It isn't something I need to change. I wish it was so I could. And it''s been going on so long that it isn't a matter of time. This is the way things are. And the way things are is things keep getting worse. I can't see any reason to keep living because I can't handle it anymore. If I just disappeared no one would care or notice because they don't care or notice now, while I am here. I am dead serious when I say no one.

Thought I'd post, because I don't know what else to do in this moment.  I'm incredibly low right now, alone and watching tv.
I went out for a coffee this morning with my dad. Things like that can provide a distraction for a bit.  I did have an undercurrent of anger and irritability as I sometimes do.  My family are quite accepting of me, considering.

I am feeling terrible.  The depression and anxiety have a menacing edge.  Can't help crying.  I've got my cat on my lap, and that makes me cry more. 

I'm doing all the right things now - I go to a monthly bipolar support group, I now see the psychiatrist and have just started taking meds again.  I started seeing a private counsellor, and sometimes call the Samaritans helpline if I feel very bad.  But it feels hopeless, and the pain is there.

I have a few friends, but I always have a guard up and see no point in telling them about my diagnosis.  I really only trust people in a surface/shallow way. 
I just feel awful, and can feel it getting worse over time.  My head feels a bit fuzzy, and I do wonder sometimes if I'll snap one day.
If things continue like this, I might have to call my gp and ask to be admitted to hospital?  Because I do have suicidal thoughts.  It's not that I truly want to die, but I want to escape this, and how I feel about myself.  It's a resilience thing.

I've never been admitted to a psych ward, and I'm in the UK.  Can anyone tell me what to expect please?  Could it provide me with a time out from life, and to get adequate help?
Can I keep my phone while there?  I don't want friends and people to know about this.",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,95060,public,self,,,Menacing feeling,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/eqwxzt/menacing_feeling/,house_only,1

When depression is so dark you can’t take anymore-
So you go to your pdoc to help find a cure
And you spin the roulette wheel and find a new pill
Hoping that this one will cure all your ills.
The fog slowly lifts, “Hurray this one isn’t shit!”
And in the back of your mind winder “Can I still do it?”
Sure you don’t want to die and you cry a lot less
And you don’t feel like you’re carrying a weight on your chest-
Then with bae or alone you feel that old feeling 
And your heart starts to race, it sounds so appealing.
So you stroke and you touch, you kiss and you bang 
In the back of your feel that familiar pang:
The pills that you take to make you not feel so glum
Are making it fucking impossible to cum.

So I say this next part and I don’t mean it with sarcasm:
I’d rather want to die a little than not have any orgasms.

So I’m at a loss. Idk where to even begin. I was working a job for the past year that was three nights afternoons, two nights midnights. This made it really difficult to take my medication (10mg saphris) and are any real effects from it. 

Fast forward to the middle of December, I quit that job. Get a regular 9-5. Quit taking my medication completely because I was afraid I wouldn’t wake up in the morning for work because my saphris made me sleep like the dead for 13-15 hours a night. But I felt surprisingly ok without my medication. My boyfriend of two years and I were doing decent. I felt a fog lift.

Then over the past month, he’s been starting up a business two hours north of where we live. He would be asleep when I would leave for work and gone when I would get home from work. He would come in around midnight with his friends while I would be trying to sleep. We saw less and less of each other. Things were crumbling. 

I expressed my feelings about it to him, but he brushed it off. He got increasingly angry. The verbal abuse picked up. He did things I never thought he would. Threw stuff at me. Spit at me. Treated me like this in front of people. And with that, I picked back up with self harm. He went out of town Friday night for the weekend. I got home from work and broke down. I cut myself all over. Called a friend to talk. She tells me how she doesn’t trust him. I ask why. She tells me she didn’t want to tell me before, but that she knew he was on hard drugs. Which was something I had been thinking for quite some time, however, I never had the concrete physical proof. She said she has seen him do it before and he would beg her not to tell me. 

After that, I did some investigating of my own. Four different people confirmed what I was told. I confronted him. Told him I already knew. And that if he would just admit it, I would be mad, deal with it, and work through it. He refuses to admit it. So I freaked out and told him I was done. I went to the bar and made so many sloppy mistakes just because I was angry and upset. The next day I packed up all my belongings in our apartment, took my dog, and set myself up at my parents house. 

I keep getting panic attacks now. I’m constantly shaking. My chest is tight. And I cry in bursts. I know I don’t deserve the things he put me through. But I’m so scared to start over and be alone. We’ve talked briefly since it all happened. He says I gave up on him. That I walked out. And it hurts me. I’m at a loss. I don’t know what to do or where to turn. I feel more alone than ever. 

Did I overreact about everything? Am I really the bad person in this situation?

We started seeing each other about 4 months ago. Our first date was to go see the movie “Joker” we had met through tinder. She picked me up and we had the whole movie theater to ourselves and were able to recline our seats and enjoy the movie while just being just overall goofy with each ofther. Fast forward to the next time we hung out a week later. We decided to watch the lion king which was a terrible idea we both fell asleep 😂 I decided that it was time for bed she instantly jumped on top of me as soon as I went to lay down. Now I wasn’t the one to initiate sex and was dominated honestly and I loved every minute of it it was a change of pace and amazing. She never was able to have multiple orgasms before me and that was the first time it happened. Right after that all I wanted to do was hold her and never let go and she wrapped around me with her legs and body. I’ve never been more connected with someone ever in my life. Now over the course of 3 months we spent every weekend together (Friday-Monday morning). I learned that she was dealing with a conflict with her and her head and wouldn’t really open up putting her feelings to the side until one day she got really drunk and opened up to me and it was the only time she would ever open up was when she was drunk or under the influence of cocaine. I don’t drink or partake but I didn’t judge her at all but, I became frustrated with the fact that’s the only way she would be more open with me but I understood. Everything was cool until she told me she loved me and I felt that soul connection she even told me she had plans to move and be closer to me. That all changed her cousin had gone thru a rough breakup and needed a roommate to help her with bills and such so she decided to take responsibility for it and help out her cousin. I didn’t see her for 4 weeks and we had made plans to spend New Years together and when the time came she forgot about me and I told her I hope she has fun and enjoys herself but felt I was kinda rude....so I apologized for feeling like she was obligated to hang out with me on a holiday and she snapped at me and told me I don’t want a relationship right now it’s too much when she just told me she loved me and wants a future with me I was hurt and told her when she wants to be friends again my door is open. She ended up coming back saying she was sorry and wanted to remain close to me and said she was coming back but, she couldn’t go back to how things were. She told me she can’t do feelings and life wasn’t the best for her. Now she had flaked on me before and I let it go then it happened again. 
She told me she had a mental problem and thought she was bipolar. Here’s where instead of saying I understand I’ll be here. I told her that when she gets her life on tract in this time she should go she a psychiatrist because the fact you feel so disconnected to everything is a sign of a mood disorder. She blocked me and I got mad so I said something hurtful that I can’t take back. I miss her so much and it’s only been a couple days I know I’ll never get her back but I was only being honest because I myself am bipolar so I get it. I feel so empty right now I’ve never loved anyone like this in my entire life. I don’t know what to do...


Another thing was i always tried to show her love in my own way since ive never been in love. I would make sure when she was here I pampered her the whole time from giving her full body massages, cooking for her when she got off work and when she spent the weekend over. Waking up at 5 am when she had to work to make her coffee and make breakfast to take with her.  Washing her clothes and work clothes all the time. When she would want to drink I’d be her own driver so she was always safe with me. My hands would cramp from how much I massaged her but I’d fight through it. We never argued or got into fights. It just hurts I tried to be the best person I could be to her.",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,95072,public,self,,,I lashed out during an episode and potentially lost the woman I love the most...,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/er1aed/i_lashed_out_during_an_episode_and_potentially/,house_only,1

When I was a child/teen, things were bad at home.  Basically, my mother was an alcoholic, and hell to live with.  Because I felt so trapped, I self-harmed, and attempted suicide twice.
I believe that the depression was very much reactive back then.

Anyway, though she says she's sorry for ruining my childhood, and is trying to make up for lost time (she never can), the truth is that even if appearances suggest that we get along now, I will always harbour resentment, and never fully trust her, because I know what she is capable of.

She's been trying to be supportive by watching youtube videos on bipolar.  But here's the thing, when I told her yesterday that my childhood had a huge impact on me, that, indeed if I was already predisposed to bipolar, my childhood was a hefty catalyst, she basically was like 'I've watched loads of videos, and it can't be triggered'.  What do you make of this?

I feel this great anger towards her for basically copping out and blaming the bipolar for how I am, thus denying that I have unresolved childhood trauma.  Convenient for her and her conscience.

Producing music, singing, sitting outside, smoking a cigarette, writing. Nothing works at all. To counter this I usually just smoke a ton of weed, but that's turned into a huge addiction. 

I'm also really depressed because I just failed out of a really good school. Did well last year even with a mixed episode in the second semester. But last semester I had no motivation, and didnt stop for a second to think about the consequences of not getting my work done. I also was dealing with a manipulative neighbor that demanded money from me and called my loved ones names. He was an alum but I didnt even bring it up to anyone. He would make me say that I think we are friends and then turn around and pound on my door, screaming at me. He would stop over constantly in times I forgave him even after I said I was trying to get work done. I didnt finish anything and didnt even withdraw, so I was dismissed. My appeal failed, and I can send one to the dean but only with another reason for failure that I didnt mention. It's due tomorrow but I don't have a reason, I was honest in the first appeal and just said I was struggling with multiple issues and couldnt perform academically. I'm wondering if I should try to send another appeal as I care about my education deeply. However, I think it will be denied anyways. 

I dont know the process to apply to a new college after being dismissed, so I feel totally lost. I also feel shame for failing out of a top school. In addition, the lack of pleasure and depression makes it so I have no hope and no goals for the short term. I want to find a job but dont want to deal with the social anxiety. Sorry this became a rant about my life. I went off topic. Haha. But does anyone have any advice? 

I'm also tired of being targeted by narcissistic people. I'm a strong person and also very forgiving. This has lead to me being in terrible situations. For example, I was friends with this person who slapped me across the face within two weeks of meeting me. I continued being friends with them even though I had a separate, stellar group of friends. Two semesters ago they told me lies about my girlfriend that caused significant trouble in my relationship.

I am your typical ‘think something is wrong but too worried/unsure to get help’. I know, go to a doctor if you think something is wrong, you can’t diagnose me and neither can I. I have a few things on my mind that I hope someone might be able to give me some insight on. Not so that I can use this to self diagnose, more because I have trouble looking at my life objectively and would benefit greatly from an outside opinion. 


1) Does this sound like possibly manic behavior? This took place one year ago.
 
•End of summer:
- Was working a lot and sleeping very little, taking adhd medication to help wake up in the mornings. I was tired most days but stayed up late because I didn’t want to go to sleep and have to work again. 

- One night I had the idea to pierce my ear. I had to do it right then even though I knew deep down it wasn’t good. I did it in the bathroom with a safety pin. It felt like I was driven to do it and was extremely impulsive/spur of the moment. I took it out a few days later.

- Remember a few days/streaks of being very horny, don’t know the exact

• Fall
- Return to college, where I continue to play on an athletic team. This team was my everything. 

-Decide to join a fraternity because I want to party more. As I am pledging I am incredibly stressed, sleeping very little, and taking more of the adhd medication than usual to help me pass my classes. I sleep 5~hrs avg due to work load.

- I start to feel like I am losing my mind. I remember feeling elated occasionally and feeling like know some special ‘enlightened’ secret as I walk home one night. Some nights I see shadows moving out of the corner of my eyes as I study. I feel paranoid that people watch me, especially in the bathroom. Everything eventually went away permanently except for the feeling watched, which only happens sometimes.

- Somehow do well in all of my classes. Finish pledging the fraternity. Begin to party a LOT. This is where the ‘sexual rampage’ starts. I begin to hook up with different girls several times per week. Rarely even two during the same party. This is very unlike me normally, as I am generally somewhat reserved.I had more sexual encounters during those few months than I have cumulatively any other time in my life. This is very confusing for me as I am unsure if this activity was the ‘honeymoon period’ of frat life or something else. 

- One day I wake up in someones bed I med the day before, and before getting out of bed sign up to be a electric scooter charger as it seems fun.... Got the chargers but never actually use them. 

- Impulsively cause moderate damage to my rented property with two other friends in a goofy ‘project’ laughing and being very jovial. I was definitely the ring leader. All of my roommates are very angry and I did not understand why. This lead to a bad argument/conflict.


- Near the end of the semester, I begin to dislike my sport and team strongly. At the time I felt like I had disliked it for a long time, but from my journal I now know that I had only been feeling that way for a few weeks. I quit the team because I felt like it was holding me back from doing all sorts of wonderful things and partying more. 

- I enter a fiery relationship, which fizzles out to nothing over a month or so because I begin to flake out on plans frequently. 

• Winter
- I struggle to eat enough a lot. Felt definitely depressed complete with suicidal thoughts for around one week or so, but think that I was moderately depressed for longer before and after that week. I think through the rest of the year. 

- The ‘sexual rampage is over’. A girl tells me that I was exceptionally charismatic and seductive during one night in the fall, making me think that I acted differently back then.

- Friends tell me that I either talk way too much or not at all. 


2) I think that some of my activity isn’t exactly normal, especially the paranoia/weird elation stuff. However, during that time I was at my peak of sleep deprivation and adhd medication intake. What I am wondering is, were all of these problems simply caused because I became very sleep deprived, stressed, and strung out from the adhd meds? I am not sure if I am just trying to justify my weird activity with the strenuous time in my life. 


3) I am very scared to get medical help for a few reasons. 

• I half think that I am making up or somehow giving myself these problems subconsciously because of health anxiety? 

• I do not want to burden my parents with worry about me.  

• I am embarrassed for friends/family to know that I have been struggling.

I know there’s not much I truly can do so I try to hold her and be as supportive as I can and that might help for the day, but it will start all over again the next day and it’s been like this for the last few weeks. We’ve been to couples counseling, individual therapy, she has a psychiatrist who prescribed her meds (she started lithium this week), and this daily trend continues. It has been incredibly frustrating and draining for me. The gf I fell in love with is happy and fun loving and constantly laughing and a source of positivity in my life. The gf of the last few weeks is dark and hopeless and irrational. I’ve been questioning the sustainability of our relationship these last few weeks which pains me. I am looking for any advice or insight or stories from those in similar situations. Any help would be appreciated.

I don't visit the sub very often and rarely post anything(haven't posted anything in a long time). I'm not in a very good place right now. Sorry if this comes out looking like a mess. I want to talk about my life first so maybe you'll get an idea of what I'm going through and how I feel. I won't go into too much detail about everything though. I guess I'll start with my age and illness. I'm certain I'm 24(I forget my exact age sometimes, I haven't had a birthday celebration/party in 6-7 years so maybe that's why but certainly 24) male and I have scitzoaffective-bipolar type. I've suffered with mental illness since I was 14 starting with some really bad depression at 14.

 I think I developed a scalp condition first while trying out for football in school(I ended up quiting a month or two in) which got really bad, very painful, hair falling out in clumps, scalp smelled foul and made me very depressed and suicidal for a long time. I felt I was doomed. It soon led to suicide attempts at 14. I tried to kill my self by drinking glass cleaner mixed in a drink, of course that didn't work. I gave it another shot soon after the first attempt but this time with lots of pills, I was determined to end my misery and believed I would succeed this time. NOPE!! I took two handfuls of pills, I went to lay down, closed my eyes, wanted to go to sleep and never wake up. Don't remember if I went too sleep or not but after awhile or the next morning I realized I failed again and all that happened was red/ bloody? diarrhea that looked like red mud(did not have access to Internet at the time to look up effective ways to kill myself). (This post is getting long and I apologize, I'll get to the point soon.) I didn't know what to do after that so I guess I just stopped trying to kill myself for awhile. Never told anyone about it not even my mother(did tell some therapists though). Anyway during this time I had no friends, I isolated myself, I was a complete loner(still am) all through out high school, kept to my self, didn't speak to anyone(who would want to talk to me with the disgusting scalp problem I had?) and stayed indoors hiding because I felt like a disgusting cyst monster. We also moved a lot which made keeping friends hard and eventually lead to me not making an effort to make friends. Whats the point of making friends if I'm just going to move to a different place and different school every 2-3 years and never see them again. (I'ma get to the point now because this post is getting too long and people might not want to read it all)

 Because of all this I missed out on a lot of experiences through out the years. Missing experiences that have consumed my mind these past 3 days(I've been feeling down the past 2 weeks but, these last 3 have been really hard on me)Experiences I strongly regret not being able to do. Experiences I believe are important to a young teen/young adult. Experiences like having your first girlfriend/boyfriend, your first kiss, losing your virginity, hanging out with friends at the mall and going to a rave or concert with your best friends and generally having fun in life. I never got to live those moments. But you know what really pains me? What really gets to me? You may think it's silly but It really hurts. THE PARTIES. The High school house parties with friends, college parties, binging on alcohol, letting loose, having fun and experimenting with drugs. You may be thinking why is doing drugs important? I dont know. But what I do know is the parties and the no friends thing is really bothering me. I haven't had any kind of friend for like 10 years and it's getting to me. I don't even know how to socialize or make friends it's been so long. The thought of talking to strangers scares me. It seems very likely I'll always be a friendless virgin loser. So yea, ive been crying these past 3 days in a dark room with the curtains closed. Lying in bed listening depressing songs all day thinking about this shit non stop. Haven't eaten in 3 days and hardly drink anything. I can't help but feel theirs a hole that needs fulfilling. I feel so much regret. It really fucking hurts. I want a friend, I want feel wanted, I want feel like I belong somewhere, I want to Party! I'm sick and tired of being alone with nothing to do on a Friday night. But I know the kind of parties I want are unacceptable at my age, the time has past and i have to be a ”responsible adult"". But still I cant help but feel I need those experiences in my life. Life doesn't seem worth living, I missed out on too much. Anyways this post is getting very long and I didn't think I would write this much. It's also getting late(for bipolar people I guess) so I don't think people will see this. 

Anyways enough about me(I had to vent, I'm sorry), now for the questions 

1. What's having friends like? Are you close? Do they know about your illness? Are they supportive of you?

2. This one I really want to know about because I have no clue how it feels. What's partying like? Did you go to parties in high school? What about college parties? What kind drugs did you experiment with as a youngster? Do parties make you feel good/bad? Tell me more about your party experiences good or bad.

3. What's it like being a wild teen/young adult(if you were). I never got to be wild, I just stayed in my cage:( If you weren't wild what are your best moments/experiences as a teen/young adult 

I guess that's all my questions. Writing all this has gotten tired and my chest feels a little heavy or achey? I don't know. I hope someone reads the questions at least. I'ma take long hot shower now and escape to my own tiny  world that is the bathtub and just sit there listening to the ”rain” falling(shower head).

Called my mom and she said, “oh yeah I don’t use it so I called it in as a suspicious charge so I don’t have to pay for it anymore.” Umm...she’s been paying for it for over a year.

Sidebar, my lease is up in a couple weeks and she offered to let me stay with her until I find a new place to live. I haven’t said yes or no because her place is very small and she’s a hoarder. There’s one trail to get around her home and you can’t even shut the door to the bathroom because of all her stuff. 

So I asked her why she didn’t just tell me she didn’t want to pay for it. Her reply? “Well maybe I’ll consider paying for it again if you decide to live with me. But only then.” This isn’t the first time she’s done it. She’ll say she’ll pay for something, but only under a condition that’ll benefit her. Or offer to pay for something and then give me a “bill” for it later.

I'm constantly having to solve mine and others problems in situations that are a lot of times beyond my control. I also have issues with caring too much when it comes to certain things and being way too nice at times.

Want help as quickly as possible so will try to keep this a brief as possible to see if anyone here as some advice.

I am too smart for my own good and I know as Albert Einstein said the intelligent are often misunderstood ( not sure but I think this is a misquote and too tired to bother finding the exact person who said it or if it is infact a misquote). I have serious trouble getting people to listen to me and take me serious cuz my stories and beliefs and the things that I say are so fucken crazy that people don't believe that all this shit happened but it did. I have witnesses and digital evidence and my photographic memory to back up my life's giant ass list of crazy bullshit.

Like today I'm having serious issues with my work computer and IT replaced everything except the harddrives... Still broken and has new issues. I even had to mention to IT that these Australian enemy's of mine may try to or succeeded in hacking my work PC. They already fucked with Bank and personal PC by going through my router and tapped my phone.the police in both countries don't believe me and don't care. Also tried the FBI who just ignores me. Presently trying to get a lawyer in Aussieland but I think he may be trying to scam me out of 3500 dollars. I gave him my story as requested, he asked for the above amount like 4 months ago paid it 4 months ago, was told by the law clerk that he would get back to me in a week I believe it was. He didn't. I got laid off. Had to deal with  job hunt then moving for new job so that is priority over lawyer shit. Well I messaged him on the 31st. He claimed they were closed until the 6th and he would get back to me then. Welp he didn't and emails to his law clerk bounce.

Also today I was told the producer was upset about stuff not being done done. It works but has bugs. Sooo lots more overtime for me yay. Gotta have it fixed by Monday.

Then today I found out my brother is back in juvie for the fourth time this year. Which means he will probably mean there at least a year. He has been charged just in the last year with assault, possession of weed and tobacco, destruction of property, and petty theft. This time he was trying to shoot my sister with a BB gun while he was locked in the bathroom to hide from him.

Then when I finally went to go home it has snowed a ton. Plows did not happen. I had to walk in the road 10 min in snow and 29 degree weather.

I know for a fact that while I do not know everything I am smarter than most people including everyone in my family and every doctor I have ever come in contact with. Also doctors who have ""treated"" me don't take me seriously and I have sooooo much shit going on and that has happened to me in my life if a psychiatrist actually sat down with me and discussed my issues and latest in my opinion too quickly made diagnosis I think they might come to a different conclusion maybe. I'm not going to rule out the possibility of me having bipolar but I am also not going to say it's 100 percent something wrong with me. knowing the symptoms of other mental disorders you can see how wrong diagnosis get made allllll of the time.

I don't have a doctor since I moved cuz my
West coast one gave me 6 months of scripts right before my last insurance ran out. I feel I need med changes because melotonin is not cutting it and I have been working crazy overtime hours this week. And been drinking shit tons of caffeine. It's a viscious cycle and leave work time and actual sleep time keeps getting pushed further and further each day. But since the time I have to work doesn't shift I am struggling to get sleep and now even though I am tied and want to I can't sleep.

In one hour I will have been awake for 24 hours. I have zyprexa to take as needed and so I took some but it hasn't been long enough to get the effect of ending this madness hopefully yet. It is as needed because I talked to my doctor about my serious weight gain on it and he told me I could just take it when I can't sleep.

I cant go to a hospital right now because it's Crunch time, my team is understaffed, and if I do I'm likely to lose my job because they really need me. I know legally they can't fire me when I take medical leave but I know that they could just make something up or begin looking for a reason to fire me.

Is it possible my last doctor could accommodate a much longer than normal appointment through the phone and send scripts to Walgreens? I feel I need meds changed and if I try to get a new doc it could take months and I don't have months. should I just go to a urgent care? Can't go to hospital or I will lose everything I worked for for 21 years to get to where I am today.

Be patient with your doctor. We are, after all, pun intended, patients. Give them time to figure out the right meds and doses for you. They are only human, and sometimes we forget that.

Be patient with your loved ones. They have their own troubles to deal with. Sometimes they may not seem to understand us, but people in general are difficult to understand.

Most importantly be patient with yourself. Sometimes we make mistakes when we are manic, or feel like crap for no apparent reason. Bipolar be like that. Don't be too hard on yourself.

It is easier said than done, I know. If you want to foster patience, or any other virtue for that matter, you need to be on medication that stabilises your mood. I cannot imagine being patient with anything if I still had my mood swings.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 in late September after many years of struggling with episodes of mania and depression. When I’m manic I’m angry, and over sensitive. I take everything seriously and feel like an exposed nerve. I’m never really happy when I’m manic, just kinda feel l more empty than I do when I’m depressed. 

I have a partner of 7 months, she is the reason that I sought treatment in the first place, and I honestly believe that I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for her. She’s done so much for me, and has put up with a lot of my shit while I find the right dosage of Lactimal, as well as two sleeping pills that put me to sleep and keep me asleep throughout the night. Before these meds I was awake every two
hours, and often laid in bed for several hours before I was able to fall asleep. It affected my job performance and my education for several years and I lost a lot of time that I could have been progressing. 

My girlfriend has done so much for me, and I always feel like I’m one episode away from losing her. She says she loves me and supports me through everything I’m going through, but between her struggling with her own mental health issues and the ups and downs I feel like I experience on a daily basis I’m afraid she’ll leave me. We were friends before dating, and I’d be truly lost without her. 

I guess I’m writing this post to vent, my friends don’t really understand why I act the way I do. My parents generally think I’m faking it, but have become more supportive as time goes on. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 4 years ago when I was a freshman in college, and it went ignored because I didn’t feel like I had the support I needed. 

The other reason I’m writing this post is to find a way to control how I feel. I’ve pushed so many people away due to how I act and I really don’t want to push her away too. I’m still learning to deal with this, and even though I’m familiar with the feeling I still don’t know how to help it. Does anyone have any advice on how to control my sensitivity when I’m manic? Or am I doomed to being this way until I can find the right medication for me?

a)  He is a billionaire

b)  Has an IQ of 200, and eidedic memory

c)  Owns properties and restaurants, even entire shopping malls.

My question is:

When the mania is over, and he is back on the ideal regiment of medication, do these false beliefs simply disappear?  Or does he still have them, but is able to just shut them out?

The reason I ask is that, some of these beliefs that he has, while wrong are not completely outrageous, such as:

d) He believes a prostitute he hired is now his girlfriend and loves him.  (Naiive, sure, but not crazy.)

I doubt he would ever have thought this while 'sane', but when he is cured, would these memories/beliefs still be there?

I'm asking because I'm trying to find some sort of way to measure if he is getting better or not.  And also, because I'm truly curious.

The mania was intense, and that has been 'cured' fairly quickly.   He is calm, and relaxed, but still believes a,b and c., and d.

Maybe some of you can share what you remember after mania, and how you reconciled the false beliefs with reality?  And what should I use as a guideline to see if he is improving?

I just realised that I have been on lithium for almost two years now and since my nurse and doctor always compliment me on my medicine compliance, I thought it might be nice to share what helps me. So in these two years, I have missed only one dose, which I think is kinda cool, go me!

There are 6 things that I think are key to my success:  
1. Time: I take lithium twice a day with the 12-hour gap in-between and I put some effort into thinking when might be the best time to take my meds. I came to the conclusion that for me, those times are at 8:30 and 20:30 since I'm almost always at home before 20:30 and I almost never have classes before 8:30 and it is not impossible to wake up at 8:30 during the weekends to take my meds.  


2.  Alarms: I have an alarm at both 8:30 and 20:30 in case I am asleep or forgetful. I cannot ignore the cellphone alarm, and I always have my phone with me.  


3. App: I use an app called Medisafe which allows me to mark when I have taken the lithium and I know for sure if I have done so or not. The app has a lot of other features as well that can be useful but I mainly use the reminders.  


4. Medicine box: I use the one in the picture, it is called ""Anabox"" and I'm not sure whether it's available everywhere but I found it at a pharmacy here in Sweden. Whenever I leave the house for the day, my Anabox of the day is with me. Regardless if I know I'll be home before the next dose, I take it with me just in case. I can be spontaneous without worrying about my meds.  


5. Smaller medicine box: in addition to the Anabox, I have several small medicine boxes that I have put in places I often spend time at. For instance, I have one at my mom's place as well as at my workplace. I also have one in each of the bags I regularly use. If I would forget the Anabox OR if I would sleep at my mom's, I still have my next-day morning dose etc. The smaller ones are also more pocket-friendly so if I know that I will be on a walk with my dog when the alarm goes off, I can carry the smaller box with me together with a bottle of water.  


6. Fill-your-medicine-box-day: choose a day of the week when you are almost always at home and can fill up your medicine for the week. I do this on Sunday nights but go for what fits your schedule.  


Friends, feel free to share what you do to make sure that you take your medicine.

Anyways, the second month (though, I haven't actually started taking it yet) my cost to the pharmacy is over $150 and on par with drug price minus insurance payout minus cost savings.

Mostly just wondering if this happened to anyone else. It sounds extremely suspicious or morally wrong that a company would be getting people hooked on a drug like this then jacking up there price but I certainly wouldn't put it past a drug manufacturer in America.

All that being said, my insurance company doesn't seem to know about the cost savings that I'm receiving, so I should get my out of pocket maximum met pretty quickly which would help me afford a surgery I've been putting off so I might just do it.

When I am manic I am tense as a rock. All my muscles in my face, hands, legs feet are active, I have tremors. I notice the next day after a particularly manic episode I hurt all over from the extended tension.

The mechanism of action in  lamictal and other mood stabilizers act on ion channels, like potassium etc. Please correct me if I am wrong but these are somehow regulated through mood stabilizers to prevent fluctuations, the highs and lows.

I tried an experiment and started an electrolyte supplement powder with all your necessary ions like potassium, sodium, chloride, a few b vitamins and a decent amount of vitamin c as a bonus. I exercise a regularly and wait until after exercising to take it.

I have noticed I so much more stable. I am so much less tense in general and have been sleeping much more soundly because I can relax a little more than usual. My body recovers now after workouts and I can only attribute it to no longer being so tense.

Any advice regarding my diagnosis would be appreciated although I understand everyone is individually different. I have so many questions. 

During the 1.5hr assessment the Psychiatrist also sent my General Practitioner a referral for an EEG as he seems to think I’ve also had seizures (I have been to the emergency room on a few occasions for leaking strange fluid and separately I pick/twitch occasionally) 

I did find a couple of articles written for research or by Doctors explaining that although bipolar and epilepsy aren’t “related” they can come from the same gene or something. 

Does anyone else have both? Just to get an idea of how common that would be. 

Also, I’m not medicated yet. After trying numerous anti depressants (they sent me manic although at the time no one could work out what was happening) My Psychiatrist has recommended a mood stabiliser and that I research Lamotrigine. He said if I do have seizures this will actually help both disorders too.

I’m newly diagnosed and I’ve been taking a low dose of Seroquel for about 5 months now. I usually take 25 mg but my psychiatrist recently bumped me up to 50 mg during the week after my period, as that’s when my hypomanic/manic symptoms seem to be the worst. It’s working well and I’ve been doing that for about 2 cycles now. A week ago, I noticed some strange tiny bumps on my left arm and on the palms of my hands. There are just a couple at a time. They usually appear in the morning and then fade by the end of the day. They don’t itch and resemble tiny reddish blisters. I’m wondering if this rash is related to my recent increase in medication? Does anyone else have experience with a rash like this?

Did anyone else feel abandoned by their therapist once they went on vacation for a couple of weeks during the holidays?

When she actually did come back, I didnt want to see her. It wasnt until this week was when I went back to therapy. Even after not seeing her for three weeks, I did not want to see her. She asked me If I would be coming back in one week or two weeks and I told her one week when I saw her earlier this week. I actually felt worse when I saw her, It was almost like a reminder that Im super depressed and require weekly treatment. I had been doing okay after a week or so of not meeting with her. Now a day later, I still have that feeling that something is wrong. Now Im thinking that I dont want to come back next week. 

This entire time that I have been in therapy I have wanted to just figure it out by myself. Sometimes I just want to show her that I can do all of this by myself NOW. I have been in therapy for awhile and Im just disappointed that Im still here. I never thought that I would be in therapy for so long. Because I have been in therapy for so long I sometimes feel like my therapist isnt doing her job. Sometimes I dont think she can help because she has never been depressed before. Sometimes I think that Im just wasting my time. I have social anxiety and Im pretty anxious during our sessions. I feel like Im just wasting time talking about my depression all of the time.

I'm really depressed and I'm just wondering how you guys deal with knowing that it will never end. I know the depression gets better, but I always know it will gets worse again. I'm on meds and I was stable for a solid few months. Then something bad happened and I got sad and sadness became depression and then i got euphoric but also angry and the whole cycle i'm sure you all know well. And all it took was this one thing, sometimes it's literally nothing. And now I'm here looking up ways to strangle myself. Not because it's unbearable to live right now, but because the existence with this goddamn disorder is unbearable. 

I grew up with a bipolar father and it was a nightmare and I ended up keeping everyone at arm's length because I hurt people when I'm hurting and it feels absolutely gutting to hurt people I love. But it also feels very lonely to do that everytime someone sees me, instability and all. I'm constantly apologizing because  I want to be better and I want to do better but it's just so awful that I actually have very little control over it. I'm just not the person I want to be and to think that this will never change and that I'll just have to deal sounds absurd.

I can take care of my cats, thankfully. They're so happy and fed and watered and their litter boxes are kept cleaned and I'm proud of myself for that, but I'm letting myself go. I haven't showered or left my apartment in a week. I haven't even walked through my building to do laundry. I'm overwhelmed with anxiety and depression and I'm stuck with what to do. 

I don't know whether to go intensive outpatient because I genuinely don't believe that I will actually go, but it seems like I need more than therapy every two weeks. I'm not experiencing any suicidal feelings or any impulse feelings, I'm just... existing. 

I have no joy, everything hurts when I move, I'm sleeping 15 hours on average, school starts the 21st and everything is online so I'm sure I'll do the work, but leaving my comfort area gives me such fear I don't know what to do. 

My mom's birthday was yesterday and I didn't even go see her even though we're incredibly close. She understands and I'm communicating with the people in my life what I'm feeling, but no one knows what to do. 

It's like I'm at a stalemate with myself and I'm either not eating or over eating when I'm awake. I'm in bed at every second. 

I think the trigger point for me was that my winterim classes ended two weeks ago and I gave myself permission to rest, but this is getting out of hand. I'm genuinely terrified like no other to leave. Even the thought makes my heart race. I'm having random panic attacks for what I can tell is no reason because I'm not doing anything. 

I've never had a depressive phase this severe since high school, but even then it's never lasted more than three days and I see no end in sight. I'm just existing. I'm just here. I have no feelings except insecurity in my place and status with relationships with other people.

So, I've recently graduated from college with my Bachelor's, and even more recently signed on with a company. (It's an at-will employer so it's not like a signed a contract, I just basically mean that I signed as in written agreement to work for them.) I \[bp2\] have a friend \[major depressive\] who used to work at a group home, aiding in care for the mentally ill and other people blah blah blah, I don't know everything about the place, but she has experience with mentally ill people, right? One day, she made a comment about how she didn't feel like mentally ill people could ever work like a   
psychonormal"" person (hence my flair). At the time, I thought ""ha, fck you, I can do TWICE as much as a normie, and I'll fckin PROVE it to you."" I was so confident. And I have been through college, and the whole hiring process with this company, but today it just hit me... I'm terrified.

I've worked stupid menial part-time jobs before (menial in relation to what I want to do with my life--agriculture), and I've worked three really intensive internships and loved them. They've all been outside. I went a little crazy with this job, and it's an office job. But it's working with data from farmers. Communicating with farmers. Putting me 'in the (work) system' of a good friend of mine who one day may need a sales assistant, doing something I know I'll enjoy. I would only have to wait a few years. But in the meantime, I'll be working essentially a 9-5 job, always inside. I've never done that. I'm also very ADHD (and medicated). But I'm so scared. Some days, I'm fine. Other days, I'm not. And I don't know what to do.

**TLDR; I'm scared that my mental illnesses (BP2 &amp; ADHD) are going to make me incapable of working a job that I was so excited to take and I'm terrified.**

Does anyone have experience with inside, 9-5 jobs? How do you deal with it? What do you do on the hard days? Did you self-profess your mental illness?

I haven't had any episodes since recently, but it's mainly been this one long drawn out depressive episode that makes me feel like crap. I don't want to do anything, I have to force myself to get out of bed in the morning, and it makes me feel like I'm dragging my feet all day. I don't really come out of my house much for anything besides work, but at the same time, I don't have any friends in the area I moved to almost two years ago. 

Well, about 2.5 months ago now, I went to my regular general doctor, and when they did bloodwork, it was determined that I have an underactive thyroid. I had gained a lot of weight in the six months I hadn't seen her as well, but I chalked that off to me replacing smoking cigarettes with food, but even when I went back to smoking and eating less, the weight didn't drop off. If it says anything, the doctor I go to prints out a sheet when you're done with your appointment and the amount of weight lost/gained is on said sheet; I had gained 38.6 lbs in six months. I'm also 5'2"" so the weight doesn't look to great with me being short. I was given 25 mg of a medication, came back six weeks later to do bloodwork, and it was determined it was still low and they upped me to 50 mg of that medication. 

So, I saw my psych Tuesday. I had mentioned to him that I woke up exhausted every morning despite regularly getting 8-11 hours of sleep a night, and I had been pretty down in the dumps. I told him about the thyroid diagnoses and he pulled up the symptoms to show me that, that was probably causing my issue and not my bipolar. He scheduled me to come back in 6 weeks from now, as well as getting some bloodwork done during that time to check my thyroid again and see if it's still low after being on the meds for like a month. He didn't raise any of my current meds since he said this situation is like a double edged sword; we don't know if it's the bipolar or the thyroid causing it to act up. 

He's pretty sure that once my thyroid is stable again at a normal level, I'll go back to being my normal stable bipolar self, but until then, I'm like a sitting duck twiddling my thumbs. 

I'm getting out of the house today and going back to my hometown for a few hours (over 1.25 hours away) and seeing my best friend since the 4th grade. I told her what was up so I think maybe spending some time with her would make me feel quite a bit better. I might also visit my sister for a minute at her job since she also works in that area. It'd be nice to get out of the house for any reason besides work, even if I have to drive that distance to visit friends. 

I'm hoping things will even out for me soon. I've been having crying spells and ""meltdowns"" if the smallest thing goes wrong. It's making me exhausted on top of the getting a regular amount of sleep and feeling like I slept 2 hours tops that evening.",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94875,public,self,,,"So, my psych thinks he knows what's causing me to be depressed again.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/eq1w4e/so_my_psych_thinks_he_knows_whats_causing_me_to/,house_only,1

My wife has been diagnosed as bipolar 6 years ago and she's currently in the hospital for a second time. First time was 2 years ago (manic phase with paranoia or how it's called).
Main problem is when she starts getting high, I kindly warn her to check therapy and to go to doctor, but she starts the fight immediately, saying you're not therapist, my psychiatrist told me that I'm ok etc.
It very hard to be in a position where my loved one doesn't believe me and my observations. Are there any suggestions how to get her to believe me, so we can avoid thing escalating to hospitalisation?
We are married for 18 years now and we have 2 very good children. We didn't have any serious troubles in our relation, except some fights in high and manic parts of her bipolar.

I always thought people would normally go through these cycles but as I’m getting older(22 right now) my cycles are becoming worse. How did you decide it was time to go talk to a professional about this and how did you stop your doctor to give you normal depression treatments. My mania usually lasts less than a week so by the time I go I will either be depressed again or lacking emotional energy, I just want to say “my dude i don’t want to be happy too much it’s also very unpleasant I prefer depression over whatever this is”. Would he take me seriously? I have a problem communicating with doctors. Thank you very much! Also I am having this extreme happiness thing again today yesterday I went to counseling for the first time after a year and I think that triggered it. I was crying constantly before that and during the session but woke up to an extreme feeling of relief this morning but I barely made any progress during the session. It was a free counselling service so I can go back more but I’m really hesitant to ask for too much from them and I know they can’t diagnose so should I still go and confirm with them? but I can only talk for 1 hour.

Ok so before I took Lamictal I had a sort of fractured identity. Let me make it clear that I’m not saying I have dissociative identity disorder (DID). I’ve been doing a lot of research on DID and there are just a few things I can relate to.

When I was hypomanic it was almost like I was a different person that was unrelated to my standard self or depressed self. In my head I imagined I looked completely different (prettier, taller, different skin tone) and even gave a separate name to myself.

Unlike with DID I didn’t have any amnesia or disassociating. I don’t hold any trauma besides the difficulties of being bipolar.

There are other “selves” I had at different times connected to my emotions. Different names, ages, and genders. They looked different, dressed differently and acted differently. In my imagination I had them talk to each other. Sometimes comforting or arguing with. But it definitely felt closer to imagining than actually being another person?? I’m having trouble describing this. Other people could only sometimes see a difference on the outside.

Now that I’m on Lamictal it feels like the different selves are one self. I guess it’s because I don’t need the coping mechanism. It’s probably also because I’m not swinging from hypomanic to depressed that I feel more like one person. Sometimes when I’m very stressed I can feel myself going back.

I told myself I would write today. I wouldn’t break the habit, but today has been a very-bad-no-good-day and my mood is bad and my brain has left the building.

Here I am showing up to the page. Showing up for myself. Writing one word after another because today, that is all I have to give. The small trickle of semi coherent thoughts that have exuded the madness and anger and mess that is my mind.

I will show up for myself everyday. Even when there’s not much of me to show up for. 

Here we are together. Myself, split in two, and the page supporting us. Loving us. Being here for us as we fall apart. Messily descending from madness.
Here we are.
Reflected like bugs splattered across windshield moving too fast, our words scattered, smeared, pressed hard into the paper fossilizing this undesirable moment.

I’d rather have it burned. But it has to breathe. I’m not sure why, I just know it does.

Just breathe.
Breathe.

“We will never be the same again. But here’s a little secret for you — no one is ever the same thing again after anything. You are never the same twice, and much of your unhappiness comes from trying to pretend that you are. Accept that you are different each day, and do so joyfully, recognizing it for the gift it is.

So my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/dto6f6/first_time_posting_here_story_time_possible/) was a bit jumbled up and all over the place. To add more information from what I remember my teen years is where most of these issues became worse. Growing up in a small town with less then 5,000 people there was not much to do. I never really had ""friends"" at this place because I was a small kid which I believe I stated this in my prior story. So growing up with whom I did there we're times I would be on medication (i hated the meds) I would be woken by being spanked with waht ever they had close to them, belts, spoons, (All tho ths happend once I was spanked with a knife), The medication made me sleep which is why i was asleep.. Rittalin and a lot of other things I was ""testing"" to see what worked but i was miss diagnosted till about the age of 18. I was ADD - ADHD then PTSD, Till I was told I am Bipolar.

So one of the things I hate the most is the dreams, Reacuring nightmares of past isues waking up in a cold sweet because they felt so real again. There were times I would cry and couldnt stop when i was younger so to ""Stop"" my crying my parents ducktaped my mouth shut. They would leave there trash all over the place and I was the one who had to clean it yet couldnt keep up wit hthe demands of my homework at the time and the house.

I eventually found out what gaming was and fell inlvowe with it. My first PC game was Civ 4 + the Warlord exp. pack. It went into SWBF (Star wars batllefront 1 &amp; 2 the origenals) Minecraft, Runecape, All the way up till what i play now. Some old games I still play to date actually.

i talked to a friend about this and we kind of had a fight. she said she didn’t understand me because i’d behave and describe myself as an elegant and charming lad most of the time but tonight she’s seen a different side of me and she’s very confused. it came to a head when she suggested i had been googling symptoms of mental disorders and sort of inflicting them on myself. i feel like i have enough problems already (and have been diagnosed with a severe mental disorder) to even think about this. i honestly don’t blame her though.

not to be angsty but i don’t feel like many people could understand my mindset without bipolar disorder + a lot of issues i struggle with. my friends and family are at a wits end. sometimes when i’m crying and ranting my mum will shout at me in frustration. i don’t even dislike her for a second. because i know how hard it is to cope with me. i feel like i’m a very toxic and horrible influence. i think i know what they say about me and my moods, and i think it’s true.

i need to get away. my only lifeline right now is music, it’s 90% of my life. i was thinking about being admitted but i couldn’t function without making constant art. i think if i was admitted to a facility now, i don’t know when i’d get out. i don’t want to spend my birthday in a hospital, i don’t want to not smoke a fag for that long. i need to be out here. but it’s dangerous to force my friends and family to cope with me. i know how much it effects them. part of my brother’s mental health is influenced by me overdosing in front of him. i don’t know where to go. i don’t know who will help. i’m all alone.",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94759,public,self,,,i’m really struggling,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/epc9jx/im_really_struggling/,house_only,1

 I am currently on disability for bipolar disorder and PTSD. It was strange to hear this from my counselor. I didn't have enough time to ask her why she feels this way about me. I plan to ask her at my next session next week. 

Ive always been under the impression that I was disabled due to my mental illness but never really knew if I was actually mentally ill or just a drama queen. 
 I've been in a haze all day thinking about it. Not disabled? Is this good? Is this true? What does this mean for my future? 

I suddenly feel like I should push myself more to really prove to myself that I'm not disabled. It almost feels like a ray of hope but at the same time I feel defenseless against the world. 

I just feel strange. I keep questioning who I am today. in the past I even questioned whether bipolar was the right diagnosis because I did not want to accept being mentally ill. ('Crazy' people don't know they're 'crazy'?)Now it just feels real.

 Somehow this came as a shock (I dont know why) that I am suffering from bipolar and PTSD. My brain is just a whirlwind right now and I dont feel comfortable in my own skin.
I struggle everyday but am still trying to push through. 
I've given up drinking and pot. It's been difficult but it's really allowed me to see how my bipolar disorder has effected events in my past and present. I just feel... Odd.. Confused.. Out of place.

So i wanna make it clear that i have done mine, i just would like to hear it from people who are already living and coping with this. i really just need to know.


My suspicion that i may be bipolar started at the end of last year when, upon reflection, i noticed that my highs and lows were getting more intense. Now, highs and lows are obviously nothing new with depression but these were like, i’d be doing great for a few months as far as coping and productivity and then for two weeks i’d pretty much make every bad move i could out of some self-destructive and denial based urges. and those lows would typically end with one day of me just picking myself up and spending an entire two or three days fixing everything, with little to no sleep or food. I pretty much struggled with insomnia all year worse than i ever had, going as much as 4 days without sleep and would restrict my diet for weeks for no real reason, eating under 1,000 calories a day most days.  So yeah that was a large part of my 2019.

One event recently though has fed my suspicions immensely. I was talking with my friend about self-harm. She was talking about how upset she was about her scars. I had never understood self-harm, i guess i just didn’t get the urge to cut yourself, it kinda grossed me out. Until at one point i looked at my own arm and noticed a scar in my arm and was hit with a wave of memories from middle school. The scar was from cutting and while i don’t think i did it often, it definitely happened a few times. And i had no recollection of these events, like if you had asked me before if i had ever cut myself and my life were on the line, i’d say no.  Needless to say that sent me into a spiral of disgust, fear and trauma that lasted like the whole day. Until i just got up at one point and felt absolutely euphoric. I had been digging into all these memories, old feelings and self-hating thoughts and like that i just stopped. I wrote them all off as “anxiety” and “wanting attention” and decided i was done with it all. I was gonna quit therapy, get my life planning back together and be a new person. I felt like i was on top of the fucking world. I then proceeded to do all of my chores for the week, write a 4 page essay for english in 2 hours and made extensive action plans for the next week. 5 hours later i was in the bathroom cutting my arm and watching the cuts bleed. I managed to get through about 5 before i had to stop because every time i did it i got sick from thinking about middle school me doing the same thing. 

that was 4 days ago and I’ve been in the fucking hole since then. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about cutting really. I’ve done it twice since, just because i think it’s relaxing to bleed. I still don’t know what all of this was but i want opinions on whether this means anything as far as signs of bipolar disorder. Obviously chances are very low i had a 5 hour long manic/hypomanic episode but something about this whole thing and my journey last year just makes me very anxious. I should also probably mention that My grandmother and uncle suffer from bipolar disorder, but i do know that it’s typically first-level relation that is a warning sign.

I cant handle it. Its not like im going to try to hurt myself if she leaves me.

I thought about all my options, and suddenly the possibility of her leaving seems liberating.

Do not misunderstand, I love her top to bottom, and i do not want to see her go.

But is it bad that part of me is ready for a new adventure after 10 years?  


Her reasons for to not commit as i understand them:

I cheated alot a very long time ago

being with me is a struggle ( That i can understand, being me is a struggle...)

She still gets doubts from time to time, she wonders if there is a reason.

Relevant details about me:

Bipolar 1 with co-morbid ADHD , I have symptoms of literally everything at times so ill focus on what ruins my life the most.

Last severe Manic episode was last 2017 so 2.5 years mania clean.

Last Severe Depression episode came with no mania and sent me to the hospital, I think i have been doing better than ever after that experience.

I am a chronic marijuana smoker, and use other things sparingly 

When she asks me to do something different I do my best to change, I figure my moods always slowly shifting why resist any changes at all, especially if they will help her.

Personally i think she needs to finally get over the cheating completely. Its been 7 years. The rest is 100% her overthinking intrusive thoughts about our relationship. Im almost positive.

Question is, I know im willing to wait forever for her to make up her mind, I chose her. She is my one and only. But I need us both to be happy. When things were good they were built on a lie. Now that I know the truth, that shes been lying to me for 7 years. Ive lost progress and I dont know whats real and what matters atm.

I almost want to break it off just to see if she will beg for me back or just leave.

It made me very anxious and restless.

Not euphoric but in a very good mood and I feel very confident. My appetite decreased even more. I’m 18 y/o and weigh 60kg with a height of 185cm. So i’m already a skinny spaghetti noodle and i’m loosing weight everyday because everytime I eat something i have to force it down with water.

I’ve been socializing a lot more. I might even be oversharing.

I feel like I have a future.
For the last 2 years I’ve been in a couple different mental institutions. And I felt like i wouldn’t be able to handle life. But now I’m ready to take on the world and live a normal life.
I haven’t been feeling like that since my last manic episode.

I don’t know if the antidepressant is starting to work or if it starts to make me manic again.

My spouse is bipolar 2 with a history of pretty bad relationship with parents that have caused her quite some trauma.
We are going through a big life change, moving to another city, and last several months for both of us weren't brightest, but last week it finally took a nosedive.
We had a disagreement over some simple thing and about a week ago, and it blew up into a fight. She was already organising her online history for a while before, but after the fight her state went down, and she said she was feeling she's to die soon, so she needs to establish her will and send it to pdocs and me.
She was writing the will for the whole day without eating or rest as it was an urgent thing to do, and even if she started fine, the end result was all over the place with a lot of bold, underlying etc, and obscure metaphors, already a big big red flag, but when she have sent it, she felt better and relieved.
For a while.
As her state was already down, she started to revisit childhood trauma, and the pills her doctors gave her were only helping so much. She couldn't sleep for longer than 3-4 hours until she would wake up and start crying and the following days went pretty much like low-high-low-high-low from night to evening with shortening intervals.
All during that time she had the idea she's about to die pushing her to obsessively write down any thoughts, memories she have. It seems to be working as a coping mechanism, but with each note done, she will get obsessed with another one, after a brief relief and upmood. Lack of sleep and proper food made it worse day by day.
During all this I was doing my best comforting her, talking and giving her favourite snacks, took days off work.

Now here's the problem, I got myself into a trap where any response, except agreement and doing what she wants is met with immediate anger/breakdown, so to keep her stable I was complying with everything and not being able to draw her to healthier behaviour or understanding what is happening. Because she would register it as abuse, referring what her parents did. She also considers being hospitalised as abuse and explicitly asked not to do it.
This all eventually spiraled down to her speaking in very cryptic language and asking me impossible things, not being able to do which in the end led to her refusing to recognise me as her husband and being cutoff.

Did I just screw everything up and should've kept my distance even when she was in pain?

A bit of an unorthodox post perhaps, but I'm in the process of getting a second opinion for my BP2 diagnosis, which I felt was done too quickly and was also painted by my own want for answers for what felt broken in me.

Recently, with the new year and my insurance changing sadly one of my medications (that has aided in keeping me stable) was no longer covered. It now costs hundreds of dollars per month, which is (was) way too much for me. Me not taking this med has made me fall into a mixed episode that has been detrimental to my current mental health. In my easily emotionally influenced state I hurt myself physically. I have not self harmed in so long I cannot remember. It was a quick lapse of judgment. Unfortunately, these cuts were extremely deep. Deep enough that I knew I needed stitches. 

For two days I bandaged myself and tried to ignore the inevitable. I knew I needed to see a doctor and get my wounds addressed. I also knew that if I went to any urgent care or hospital that I would immediately be put on a 51/50 because of my documented mental health issues, my current medications I am prescribed and the nature of what I did. I also knew with my updated(shitty) insurance it would not fully cover my stay in inpatient. It would not even partially be covered. 

This lead me to do one of the hardest things I’ve had to do, which was ask for outside help. I know a women who is a doctor but I’m not close to her in any sense. I bit the bullet and messaged her. I casually talked about her plans for MLK weekend and if she was going to go camping with our friend group. Then bluntly asked her if she would be willing to help someone outside a hospital if the had a medical problem. She said yes. 

I explained to her about my situation. I told her that I am now back on this medication, even though it costs me basically two months  worth of groceries. She sympathized with me and said she would help me. She said she’ll collect supplies from her hospital for me. She told me this would be very painful. A type of pain I have never experienced and that I would need to remain still for a long period of time. In total I needed 12 stitches. She did end up somehow getting her hands on IV lidocaine to help numb me. IT DID NOT HELP. 

She had Ferris Bullers Day Off playing in the background while she stitched me up. I can’t explain the pain. I have nearly 20 tattoos and this needle was worse. The lidocaine barley took the edge off. 

The moral of my story is when emotions are uncontrollable and life feels too much to bare ask for help. Call a hotline. Post on Reddit. Whatever. Because those three minutes of release could put you three grand in debt, lose your damn leg, end a relationship or force yourself into an even more dangerous situation. It could go so bad. It is not worth it.

So, I'm 17F and have been suspecting some sort of mood disorder for several+ months. Last time I saw my psychiatrist, I brought up a few of my concerns or ""abnormalities"" in my mental state, and the outcomes. So far I've mentioned: 


- A constant state of emotional neutrality that quickly swings to anger and/or sadness, while feeling genuinely happy/excited is rare and doesn't feel real, like it's all an act. I know I've *been* happy, but I can't recount that feeling vividly like I can with sadness and anger 


- Previous antidepressants, prozac and zoloft being the worst, give me graphic and violent intrusive thoughts as well as what I can look back and recognize as a god complex. ""Everyone around me is an idiot, I'm superior and too good for this, I should unplug the power and piss everyone off just because I can, I could stab someone here and absolutely get away with it, I'm just that indestructible"" etc. I have intrusive thoughts when unmedicated but they've only ever been actively violent and malicious themes while on SSRIs


- I feel like my empathy is lacking. Everyone is and has to be either all good or all bad, and trying to see between those two is distressing. I'm generally detached from everyone (and myself) and not involved with other people, but have periods of being deathly afraid of them forgetting about me or leaving me out 


- Easy to trigger irritability and spontaneous drastic actions. I.e sending long, broody paragraphs to people about an issue that never existed outside of my perception or could've been solved if I just let the problem air out, if I accidentally kick over the cats food bowl while walking it makes me FURIOUS, little to no tolerance for small annoyances etc. I'm also unconsciously hostile towards people I love and respect 


- Memory lapses, not sure if this is more ADHD but retaining information is very hard. I'm very forgetful and easily confused 


- Every so often, I'll have a one night to week long period where I just crash emotionally; hyper fixate on one issue and break down, rarely leave bed and sleep all day. I don't think I'm chronically depressed as much as I suffer from executive dysfunction. I have short, mid and long term goals with a lot of hope for the future, and generally see myself and my capabilities in a good (although maybe exaggerated or with high expectations) light 


- My thoughts are extremely disorganized and vivid, and I get sidetracked easily. I think in lots of sound and visuals that require little focus on my part to be clear as day to me. Comparable to maladaptive daydreaming 


- History of spontaneous physical violence (SH, once forcefully shoved my mother which is still... really hard to talk about, but we've recovered from it between us) This has only ever happened when completely unmedicated. The anger and short fuse I'd get with SSRIs is still there but there's zero thought behind it 


Even after I explain that I've been physically aggressive with people, my psychiatrist says that this is a normal experience for teenagers. Judging by how dickish a lot of teens are, mostly boys from what I have seen and you never know what's going on behind the scenes, I... guess? I don't know. I haven't had the chance to *not* be a teenager yet, so I don't really have anything to compare it to. 


I'm getting my bi-monthly follow up in a few days, but I just don't know what to say when the last time I was prescribed with fresh air and a change in routine, even after mentioning that I'd actively harmed others and am afraid of doing it again because it was so impulsive. I was given no resources at all to accomplish this either other than ""the ability to will yourself to do it"". I have what I would consider to be debilitating executive function from ASD and ADHD, and making changes in how I function and think feels so impossible when even folding the laundry takes 4 hours of consideration beforehand. 


I take vyvanse for ADHD, which doesn't level things out as much as it tells my brain to internalize the anger and frustration I get from not immediately succeeding at a task into an extensive internal monologue/pep talk, which sounds weird but has been a noticeable help in starting tasks, getting things done and sparing myself the mental exhaustion. I'm still overly emotional, fine one hour and weeping the next, and cry *really* easily over basic things like seeing an old coworker from a job I used to love, even if we've both moved on. It makes things like mentioning this stuff in person very hard. 


I'm really not sure what to do here. My town has a massive lack in medical professionals in general and I've cycled through most of them in the psych department.

I’ve been dealing with massive depression for the past few months / years (it’s gotten worse as I’ve aged), and last month, my psychiatrist prescribed me lexapro and Ativan for the depression and anxiety combination. 

Now, the lexapro worked for about 18 days, but the way I understand it, on the 19th, 20th, and 21st day so far, I’ve been depressed again, acting absolutely manic. I can feel my mood shift drastically in the matter of minutes. This only happens every couple of months. 

I’m not expert, but I’m almost 100% positive I could have a level of bipolar disorder, or maybe it’s full blown. My grandfather had full blown bipolar (they called it manic depression back then), and I see a lot of traits in myself that are similar to him. 

The question I have is: is my self diagnosed enough to warrant me requesting lithium carbonate on Monday when I see the doctor? I feel like if I take another anti depressant, I’ll always revert back to these periods of mania, and they don’t really do any good for me. I want full stability to my mood and I understand that this only comes from lithium carbonate. It’s also the only medication known to prevent suicidal thinking, which I don’t have much of, but I still do.

I yawn all day long and struggle to do things with any vigor.  I started taking vitamin D supplements because I have a deficiency and assumed that was the cause of the lethargy.

The depression came back full force and left me unable to function for about a week. I finally feel like I’m getting back to normal except the that depression thoughts are still semi-present most of the time. 

The missed medicine could be the cause of the fatigue because it feels similar to the slowness I feel when I’m depressed. However I’m not convinced that’s the case because it was definitely present before that happened and the vitamin supplements didn’t stop it entirely.

&amp; i've done this in the past. with past psychiatrists, i just kept it to myself. my current psychiatrist is great &amp; i actually trust him, he also does therapy &amp; i tell him literally everything. 

he said i was playing a game, i was being manipulative. he said i've done this before (not wrong) &amp; i was trying to get him to respond a certain way. he said i was wasting the session. 

sometimes i feel like i need reassurance, to be told it's not all in my head. i feel like he's convinced i'm just borderline (i don't agree tbh) &amp; am trying to manipulate him. it felt like a mindfuck. idk.

I’m writing this for my friend. I know a lot of stuff about bipolar disorder, since I’m a psychology student and I’m basically really interested in this kind of stuff, but of course no one knows better than you guys. So, I’ve seen with my own eyes my friend in a state of mania for sure one time (and many other times during a depressive episodes whom she has been fighting for a long time), I recognized it, and now the psychiatrists she has seen are telling her she probably suffers from a bipolar disorder, but as far as I know, it is not an official diagnosis. Anyway they are giving her medications for her supposed mental illness and I just don’t know what to think. Is it safe to give her this kind of medications (and she isn’t feeling good at all since she started taking them) even if the diagnosis is not 100% confirmed? Isn’t it always the other way around? Also can the diagnosis from these doctors be legit, giving the fact that they have just met her very few times? Aren’t you supposed to know a person well before giving her/him a diagnosis? I mean, I think she might have bipolar but I don’t know, this whole situation just seems really strange to me, especially the drugs before the official diagnosis. What do you guys think?

Anyways I am an alcoholic, to date an unmedicated bipolar who is also trying to live without amphetamines and alcohol, and so far I absolutely cannot handle everything at once, especially as a full-time university student, I am scared of myself, I am scared I will act on my thoughts and am just hoping someone has been through something similar or has something useful/positive to say about my situation because at this point I will NOT make it to my 22nd birthday

It's that time again! 22F here.

Three different specialists (2 psychologists, 1 psychiatrist) agree with my BP1 diagnosis. One is my psychologist who I've seen since I was 16. One is my psychiatrist at school who, after hearing my history, said I'm ""textbook"" bipolar (I guess that means classic??). I've seen 2 other psychiatrists: 1 diagnosed me BP2 (my first BP diagnosis actually, where I withheld symptoms in my history) and my current psychiatrist, who's not giving me a specific label but calls my case ""moderate"". He likes to 'treat the symptoms'. (I know, I should focus on that, fuck a label but still)

Does anyone NOT have symptoms that are pretty classically BP1? 

I'm a college student, and I've spent over $1000 in 3 weeks before on stupid hair products and food and concert tickets. That's been my most 'reckless' spending, besides last summer when I scoured the city (I'm from New York) and New Jersey meeting up with sellers to buy a beat up bike I don't use now, for whatever reason. 

I get the energy, reduced sleep, restlessness, increased productivity to start that'd lose focus, pressured speech, pacing, decreased appetite, more social, and the teeniest bit more self-esteem, in addition to looking at the world in a completely new lens of ""wow, everything is so bright and amazing and everything is going so well and there's nothing I can't do! the self -help book version"" (and when dysphoric) get the irritability and the rage and the 'bursting out of my skin, I really don't know if I can control myself' energy. I get anxiety.

I get obsessions. Like, scrolling through the internet and can't stop, obsessing over writing, obsessing over rollerskating, researching the bike, obsessing over hair, etc. I do make impulse buys, but they're all little things; like 'oh, that's nothing, I have time for that' and a LOT of 'oh that's nothing, I have time/money for that's.

I do get more creative, but that's moreso only shows in my poetry and shelling out a poem every 3 minutes (that happened once). Most of its gibberish.

Granted, I've had some 'out there' experiences, but haven't we all? 

I've also had hallucinations, or what I think are hallucinations? 

Audio: I'd continue hearing people's conversations long after they'd stopped, and it'd come in sounding warped, like it was underwater. After a while, I started realizing I'd hear people talking that didn't start talking either. Only happened once during a mixed episode. 

Visual: I'd see scenes of people, dressed in really really bright and strange colors, in blinding light -- literally, there was a halo around them -- acting out their lives, blink, and they'd be gone. Then, I'd blink again, and they'd be back. This was during what I think was a dysphoric (hypo)manic ep, when I have lots of anxiety, paranoia of people attacking me, and lots of flight of thoughts. 

  
I've never gotten grandiosity. Only thinking 'wow, I'm so amazing at this, wow, my MIND, etc.' Never thinking I'm a god or invincible or anything. I've gotten delusions only in the hospital when I thought the staff was trying to kill me, but mostly paranoia....thinking other people or animals are trying to attack or kill me.   
I don't get hypersexual. I normally would probably identify as pretty asexual (I hook up with people once in a blue moon/get the urge (not even do it, just get the urge) every few months), but the only times I've wanted to do it, I've been hypo/manic. Once, hooked up with 2 people in one day. But, that's the only thing that's been 'weird'. Hardly hypersexual.   
I don't get racing thoughts, that I'm aware of. 

Of course, the depressions are there. Sooooo.....none of it sounds that serious, like typical BP1 to me. I read about what y'all go through on here, and for the most part, I feel like I don't go through it like that, so I feel that's not what I am. Thoughts?

When I got called to see him, I thought that maybe he was just going to release me today but he said that he is going to be at the tribunal and is going to tell them I need to stay here.

I am worried because however independent they say that the tribunal is - it is mostly based off the reports and presence of people from here.

Everything he said and accused me of, I try to explain, I give sensible reasons and he just wouldnt listen. I am very worried that this will be the case at the tribunal now and I will have no voice.

If this tribunal fails - I have very little comeback in law. No appeal, no nothing. I will be trapped indefinitely in this hellhole. Escape is next to impossible - the main door is an airlock and round the back there is a fence that is unclimbable.

Am not gonna lie - I am pretty scared right now.

But I’ve always thought of myself as someone who just chased the feeling of euphoria who just happened to have a tendency to be severely depressed. Now my doctor is telling me most of the time that I felt ‘okay’ were probably just hypomania which caused me to make stupid decisions and the cycle continues.

i asked her if she thinks i’m bipolar or schizophrenic. also, i work at a mental health facility and that alone freaks me out to my core because that’s one of my biggest fears- being put somewhere against my will, but that’s another story on its own. 

she said she thinks i just really need therapy?? ok lady i am SEVERELY ANXIOUS like waking up in a panic every morning and incredibly unstable honestly.. but i didn’t tell her i was “unstable”. 

she wrote me off for vistaril for my anxiety (after i already told her that i have been taking benadryl every night) and a script for lexapro?

I did so because of weight issues. Depakote, I believe, acts on the appetite centres of the brain. I had permanent munchies.  My understanding is that other medications which cause weight gain (e.g. lithium, quetiapine) have a physiological effect.

My history with Depakote was that when I was first diagnosed and was still in hospital, the psychiatric pharmacist gave me a choice between Dekakote, lithium and carbamazapine - but little information. These days, where I am (Glasgow, Scotland) I probably would have been offered lithium first. We have a noted local professor of psychiatry who's clear that it should be the first port of call. But I opted for Depakote because my brother was on it. A few years and a couple of episodes down the line, my psychiatrist added in lithium, largely because the Depakote clearly wasn't enough. She's hot on evidence based medicine and said there was evidence that the lithium/Depakote combination is more effective.

I made my decision based on my age. I've just turned 57 and at that age obesity can be a big problem, for many reasons.  I thought I would have to persuade my (excellent) psychiatrist, but she said 'Well - you're the one who has to take it'. I was making an informed decision between the risks of bipolar episodes and other things that could kill me.

Anyway - 20lb off so far, without trying. I can now say 'No' to food. I need to buy a new belt.

The depression is so bad that I start getting anxiety because there is nothing that will give me any relief. I also barely eat anything on this day because I am so sad anxious and agitated. I have extremely bad diarrhea all day. Then when I’ve had enough I have an extremely bad panic attack that lasts for hours into the early hours of the morning. THERE GOES MY SLEEP SCHEDULE. Finally get to sleep somehow and don’t get enough sleep because I have such bad vivid dreams and wake up still feeling like I’m in a panic and sweating. Repeat the next day just toned down slightly. Repeat toned down a little more until I return to my normal depressive self that doesn’t feel like I need to be committed for the rest of my life.

I see the downvote and I probably trigger some bad shit for people. Wich wasn't my intention. I'm sorry. I dont  want to deny any suffering from people who receceived a bdp diagnostic.  Your suffering is real, no doubt about it. So I'll try to explain more my critic of the bdp diagnostic as how it's  made in the dsm.

 1: I hate the personnality disorder part. lt's written like it's  a flaw from the personnality itself and not an actual illness that the person suffer from. An illness is something  we need to treat, a personnality is something that define a person (so  it's  kind of his own fault).

2: a lot of criteria seem copied from the old hysteria diagnostic  who was clearly misogynist. In that sense, a clear majority of bdp people are woman. 

3: a lot of the bdp person had suffer from trauma in their childhood or later in life. There's a lot of sexual agression, abusive parenting, violence.......  in their history. So many symptoms of bdp like trouble maintaining relationship, depersonnalization, feeling rejected, abandonned, bad self esteem... are normal response to trauma. 

4: The variation of mood may be in a shorter lap, but it's still thymic episode. It fit the original description of cyclothymia by Ludwig Kahlbaum. There was'nt this idea of lower intensity of episode like in today criteria. The main difference was the lenght of the episode. So this is why I emphase of bdp being a sub type of the affective bipolar illness.

5: This diagnostic come with too much stigma. Stigma that are calidated by the medical system. When someone received a bdp diagnostic where I live, they have to do group therapy, that dont suit everybody. ( i personnally like group therapy). They are also exclude from some psychosocial service that could help them because of how they are view by the medical system. Also, the meds are not systematically used and often ssri can be used alone or with only anxiolitic. When there's a tons of evidence that those meds are not good for people who experience high and down, when they aren't paired with mood stabilizer. 

In conclusion, I dont  pretend to own the truth. I'm just highly critical on the dsm over impact  in modern psychiatry. I feel we need more research and a scientific approach detach from psychanalist.

Just to clarify, I’m not referring to BP(NOS) or cyclothymia or even the temperamental versions of each mood state. 

I’m talking a about a form of bipolar that’s baseline is literally hypomania and is only up or down from that state temporarily due to PTSD or EXTREME STRESS like other the other forms of bipolar. 

This type of bipolar gets often misdiagnosed as ADHD and BP(NOS) or BP1 disorder. 

This purposed state of bipolar still needs treatment like medication, psychotherapy and daily coping mechanisms. 

I have this type of bipolar and I wasted a lot of time and money NOT understanding myself until I tracked my mood.  

The types of manic states and mild depressive states this disorder encompasses are very temporary and are caused 100% by PTSD or EXTREME stress. When the episodes are over the individual returns to a mood outside of the normal range and becomes all the good and bad that comes with hypomania. 

The solution that I purposed for this type of bipolar is 1mg of risperdone and/or depakote or lithium. No antidepressants are needed. This type often has extreme anxiety so treat with seroquel at night instead of risperdone. 

Low doses of seroquel, if you don’t believe look it up, can be potentially use for anxiety. The thing is I need like 300mg of seroquel everyday to look like a really happy normal person.  

Another part is about reducing the triggers for this type of purposed bipolar like PTSD and EXTREME STRESS, including but not limited to, abandonment issues, other peoples attitude towards life, ect. 

So the treatment for this type would be a downer of some type and/or an anti manic mood stabilizer and psychotherapy. 

This type is also often misdiagnosed for schizophrenia because of how easy it is for hypomania to turn into mania with psychosis.

There have been large periods of my life when I couldn't work or take care of myself because I was fucking depressed or manic and losing my goddamn mind. I'm trying to connect with a case worker to potentially file disability soon because I'm chronically underemployed. I dropped out of high school because I had a manic episode where I decided to move to Eugene, OR, and then hitchhike all over the West Coast. My relationship is suffering because my boyfriend is too stressed out to keep supporting me when I'm manic or depressed. I want to go to college and earn a degree in psychiatry, but I'm too afraid of what will happen if I'm hospitalized again (the next one will be there ninth time), or if I'm too fucked up to go to class or complete classwork. 

I'm going to be 25 this month, and I feel like my mental illness has really fucked up my life. Please give me some hope.",True,True,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94611,public,spoiler,,,Had it gotten better?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/eog3df/had_it_gotten_better/,house_only,1

This past  November he started showing signs of mania/hypomania  

At that time he started moving from using alcohol to ketamine, lots of ketamine

Mid December, was removed from work and checked into rehab, supposedly a center specializing in co-occurring disorder (duel-diognisis)

Checked himself out 4 days later and began isolating himself from those who were involved in getting him there

More ketamine, lot’s of ketamine 

Just before Xmas, another break, destroys his house, cops are called, he’ s arrested and 5150’d

He’s released 72 hours later

Over the next week, buy's a 50k vehicle, commissioned several other expensive paintings, and shows a general disregard for his finances 

Ketamine, and more ketamine,

The end of last week, agrees to be checked back into rehab...reluctantly.  He’s high when we show up to take him.  Car already has a busted lip.

12 hours later, we are called by the rehab ""he had a violent outbreak and was sent to the ER and is on 5150 hold again""

72 hours of radio silence

This morning, he begins calling over and over asking me to come and get him.  Telling me to call his lawyer, get his dads ass down there, etc.  I spoke to his father who was there the night before, he said they would not be releasing him.  He asked me to stop taking the phone calls.

His father, a truly good hearted and caring man.   Is doing what he thinks is best.  However, I got the impression this morning when I asked if he was being treated for BP as well as the addiction, his response was basically “Well, he may or may not be bipolar, I don’t know, we’re all a little bipolar, we all have ups and downs. What we need to do is get him clean and checked back into rehab.”  

I admittedly do not know much about bipolar, however,  I have talked to several psychiatrists and social workers this week, read lots of info in this sub,  and read Unquiet Mind and Madness.  I have a better understanding of the severity of BP1 and many of his actions seem to make more sense.

Time seems to be running short in regards to what the next steps are.

I do not know anything in regards to his medications or psychiatric help he has been receiving. 

Does anyone have advice in this situation? Facilities we should look into? People we should be contacting?  I'm not sure I even know what the right support to ask for?

Of all people I could have met in our course we just started talking and from the get go got along amazingly and like we had known eachother for ages (probably as a result of our states).


A few months ago I met a guy at a work induction and it was the same. We gelled so well together and got on perfectly and were soon talking and teasing eachother like good friends and having fun.


I don't know why but I just had a feeling in my gut that there was something about him that was different and I suspected he was bipolar.


Low and behold, after dropping him home (we live in the same suburb) after confessing his feelings for me and smothering and overwhelming me with it all, he looked at me and said, ""I had to defer my course because I had some issues...I have to tell you I have...""
My mind finished the sentence *bipolar disorder*...
He hesitated, ""I have bipolar""
I laughed and shook my head and he looked confused. *I knew it*
I told him I did too and at first he thought I was joking and then looked a bit confused...


""I would never have suspected that you had it"" he said...which confused me and I didn't know whether to take as a compliment or not. 
Only because he wasn't in training with me where I was in a mixed episode and got pulled aside and cautioned by the owner of the business for being 'too distracted'.

And to top this all off I feel like my memory has gotten worse and I’ve lost all libido I once had. Why oh why do I have to carry on taking these kinds of meds for the rest of my life. I’m not depressed I just feel like there’s nothing to live for anymore.

I mean they’re doing the job. I’ve not been manic or majorly depressed for 5 months or so but Its a big chunk of my personality I’m taking away just to be well. Perhaps I’m on the wrong medication and I need to be switched to something less strong or perhaps reduce my dose.

I’ve got a psychiatrist appointment tomorrow so I’m gonna bring up all these points to her tomorrow. I’ve never met her before so I’m a bit apprehensive about meeting her.

The thing is that I don’t know is I can wait until February. My mood has settled into me feeling absolutely awful constantly and I have no energy to do anything, including go to classes. I haven’t felt this suicidal in a good while. My academic performance is going to suffer terribly if I continue this way, and by the time February comes around I don’t know if I’ll be able to salvage it. 

I was given excellent advice to contact the office of disability services at my university which I will most definitely do, but I have a feeling I’ll need to speak with the psychiatrist first because my records are a bit wonky and because I think I need a treatment team to help me figure out reasonable accommodations.

This summer, though, my brother died. And I had to up the citalopram in order to keep my head above water. Since, I’ve noticed that I’m having more and more of what I think are manic episodes.

It’s hard to stop and settle down. I feel like something is vibrating in me all the time. Sometimes I get uncontrollably horny to the point of feeling crazy. Sometimes I can’t shut my brain up to sleep at all but then I still have energy the next day and I just keep going and going. I don’t know how to slow it down.

I know no one can diagnosis me online. I’m seeing a psychologist next week, but I just wanted to hear from others to see if anyone had had a similar experience.",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94671,public,self,,,Celexa and mania,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/eor5bk/celexa_and_mania/,house_only,1

However over the last 2-3 weeks some things happened in my life that really fucked me up and sent me on a downward spiral. I had been really happy before and even slightly manic so the crash came and got compounded by the other stuff that happened and it hasn't been very good lately. 

So I saw my therapist and Psychiatrist today and we spoke and I ended up telling them that I'd been feeling a bit suicidal recently and that I haven't been this low in a while. She recommended that I get admitted as she doesn't think I should just wait it out to see if mroe ends will help. So anyway I went to speak to my parents and tell them what was happening. They didn't how was feeling up until today when I told them and amongst telling me that I should be happy because I have help  and some people have nothing , and that I should be thinking more positively they said that they were now feeling bad and upset that they missed that. I was depressed and hadn't seen it.

Now some of the other stuff that they said i.e thinking positively and other people have it worse. That I know I shouldn't take to heart, they probably just don't understand and are trying to help. I mean they said I should have came to spoke to them but honestly we never grew up with that relationship and  I can't speak to them because some of the problems I have are rooted in the things they do and they take things to personally and get offended if I tell them that something they're doing is making me feel bad. But anyway I know they still care and so when they were saying about how they feel guilty for not picking up on how I was feeling it just really made me feel like shit. I feel terrible and now I'm second guessing thinking that maybe I'm just overreacting and things aren't so bad. That I'm just over exaggerating, that I shouldn't feel this bad and  that my issues aren't that bad. I feel like I'm now making them feel bad for nothing and I feel really guilty about it.

I've been seeing my psychiatrist for two years now. She does therapy and medication management, which is a real coup where I live because it's hard to find that for some reason and important to me for a psychiatrist because I need someone who is prescribing medication based on my entire condition and living situation. 

However, for the past year or so, I've had issues with her that have grown and grown. I don't feel she's addressing the issues I want addressed, we have a lot fundamental disagreements (for example she is a TERF and I am a queer woman who dates trans people, so it's hard talking about that with her, she believes you should only have sex with people you are in love with etc etc), and in general I find her to be old fashioned with some things, and my family/friends are concerned with the amount of medications she prescribes me. 

I was hesitant for a long time to find a new psychiatrist even though I wanted to because she had me stabilized on medication and I felt it would be too difficult reacquainting myself with someone new. However, I have been off my meds for a good amount of time now and basically lying to her. It feels like a chore going to see her, and not a healthy chore that needs to be done. I lie about where I am at in life because I don't want to get in trouble, I don't want her to up my meds, I don't want to get caught being off my meds, etc etc etc. I feel like I am basically wasting money for no benefit whatsoever.

This is all to say that I just don't think that it's good to be seeing her anymore. I feel too intimidated by her and have too longstanding of a relationship with her to be honest anymore and feel I need a fresh start with someone new. However, I have a problem with standing up for myself, both in general and with her. How do I break things off with her and start seeing someone new? I was going to attempt to lie and say I was moving to a new city, but I'm worried I'll get caught in that lie as well. I am really worried she's going to put two and two together and realize I am off my meds and try to hospitalize me. I am not in a fantastic place and do need help, but it's not an emergency. 

**TLDR: My relationship with my psychiatrist has become too complicated, I am lying to her about pretty much everything, and we are no longer well matched as I have evolved over the past two years. I want to see someone new but don't know how to go about firing her without setting her off/revealing I am off my meds anyway/getting myself hospitalized.**",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94679,public,self,,,How do I breakup with my current psychiatrist?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/eosppw/how_do_i_breakup_with_my_current_psychiatrist/,house_only,1

I'll try to give highlights (I'll try and be short but there's a lot).
She was diagnosed  at three, spent a month in children's psych ward and prescribed Lithium. Once she got out, we did all psych appointments ( individual and with immediate family). 
I thought bipolar only got diagnosed to much older kids (internet was not like it is now), so not only did I not know about this disease..I couldn't get answers or help from anyone (other than few doctors)to understand what was going on.
After that, the rollercoaster of this diagnosis went nuts.
She then spent another month in pych ward eight months later (after being put in a straight jacket -attached to a five foot board- while her room was getting ready).
Then th children's hospital just happened to stop taking our insurance (not us individually- hospital thing).
I should note that I had hope she would be okay. Hospital gave us day parenting classes, family classes (she has younger sisters), and daycare (in hospital) after she was released.
After that..she was kicked out of NUMEROUS daycares and once school started..I was called damn near once or twice a week to come get her ( w/full time job that was hard).
She ended up running away at 12 (I worked diligently with police to find her). And finally showed back up 1 1/2 years later 6 months pregnant ( baby was given to a wonderful family -open adoption- and probably the hardest thing I had to do). I actually had a nervous breakdown after hat that took me years to get back to normal (no drugs or anything).
I honestly felt I didn't know how to be a good mom.  I felt guilty because I could never get anything to work for her.
There's a ton more but I wanted to give a little background. 
She's not on meds -she stopped- (she went through so many different ones while growing up because they could never get one to work) and I'm not certain which would actually work anyway.
She, myself and her sisters (both currently in college) have been through the ringer and are emotionally exhausted, however, we never stop worrying about her.
We want (even after all this  time of never seeing progress) her to have a job, or just be plain HAPPY.
I've never posted befor and honestly am nervous telling our story.

But can anyone with bipolar, has a adult child with bipolar, or just has ANY suggestions, I would be extremely grateful.  
I know there's not a quick fix ( I stopped thinking hat 20 years ago). It was hard enough with the bipolar..now factor in drugs.
I would like to believe that there is hope for her.

Been lacking consistent progress on it. I have done some work but not made significant dent in them like I should have. 

I was severely depressed from November to December. Just heavily stressed. Now, I am stressed, not as badly but still feel a little low at times. I am having a psoriasis flare up because of it. Situational, I am sure.

My mom is not the nicest person. In fact, she’s probably the most two faced person I have ever met and pretty fake. Anyway, she stepped up her insults and rudeness during the holidays. Yesterday she had company over and as tends to be the case, she had me serve them and such. 

During such occasions she usually barks orders and physically pushes me to check what I am doing to make sure I am doing it okay (whatever it is). Somehow her friends think she’s awesome. Today, she was bullying my sister into inviting an uncle she doesn’t like to her wedding. I had called my sister to talk and she took the opportunity to make her case. While I stood there she randomly, literally, patted my pubic area and told me that I was flabby and my stomach was hanging. It was a real wtf moment for me because (1) I felt so violated (2) I absolutely don’t have a stomach roll/flab over my pubic area. 

Usually I am good about just letting her have her “moments.” Fat calling, shaming, insults, whatever. But I got really angry and went off. Told her she was rude and that she was crazy and only saying that because she is upset that she can’t micromanage my sister’s wedding. She continued and I said “you’re a real bitch, I can’t believe you can’t see how rude you are and how you have a lot of people fooled.”

Now I feel bad about that but I can’t apologize. I don’t think I said anything that wasn’t the truth. Most of my life has been this way and if I apologize I feel she will use it as ammunition to further play victim. 

Today and yesterday were days of low productivity. I went in long walks with my dog for distraction/clear my head but it is really hard sometimes. I’m really close to graduating and I am stressed about finding a job that will allow me to finally move away from her. I feel my mental health will dramatically improve. I know my sisters’ (younger and older) did improve when they left. It’s hard to breathe, let  alone work here.

I invited my partner over but he is busy and has a lot to work on as well. It would have been nice to have a soothing presence around as a buffer. Self soothing and all that isn’t working. I am just emotionally affected now and stuck in my room avoiding interaction with her as usual. I might go for another walk.",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94477,public,self,,,Hey all.

Recently we've started emailing again and we've talked about being bipolar. She's been seeing a therapist and the therapist believes she's bipolar 1, has GAD and BPD. She's been referred to a new psychiatrist for a formal diagnosis.  


She's started talking about taking medication, which she was vehemently against in her teens, because the benefits outweigh the side effects.

Hi guys,  


 I never posted here, never thought I'd be posting here either... But I need somebody to hear me.... Someone who might understand maybe... so here goes nothing....

 I been diagnosed as Bipolar 2 with Anxious tendencies at 17... they tried most psychiatric drugs but, never stuck to it... I always thought I was fine, just mostly depressed, and when I panicked I would burn or cut myself, not to die but to alleviate the pain inside, I thought ""That's what Teens do..."" Mind you, this was back when the emo phase and all that shit was waaaaaay in style.. Life went on... Most often I'd go back on meds from time to time, I'd see a psychologist and everything was, well for most part ""OK""... right up to the past year....  


 I left an emotionally abusive relationship and me and my best friend started going out ( to my surprise) 2-3 months after.. He was and still is everything I hold dear... Everything was going great, we'd be laughing all the time, stay awake till the wee hours of the night, played music together, we were growing more.. And at some point the fighting started.... At first it was little things, but little things always grow... and now well it's full on war... it's like we're not even friends anymore... Most of the time anxiety gets the best of me and I get angry,  I get depressed, I have a major panic attacks and then I burn or cut... and of course I get more depressed...   


  Fast forward to the 30th of December 2018... I landed myself at the E.R.   
 I had had another panic attack due to an argument and I was stuck that was it, all i could do was cry in a fetal position, it was like knives in my chest, I wanted to vomit, I wanted to disappear, so my boyfriend took it upon himself to call my mom for her to drive us to the E.R. to see a psychiatrist again... They prescribed me meds again and sent me home the 31st... 

 So now I've been on meds since... I keep a mood calendar and a journal just to see what I did during the day because I forget... Everything was fine for a week... no fights, all laugh and music and fun....  but the last 3 days are still filled with anxiety, panics and depression... I know that these meds may take weeks to have full effect on my body, but it's like I can't climb this hill... Me and my boyfriend go into it again... I use to panic and he'd be here still, patting my back, caressin my hair, caring, but now I was on the floor for a good hour in a fetal position, lighter and bobby pins in hand and he would just shovel everything I did wrong on me... telling me to nudge myself out on my own, how bad I push him away... I feel so needy, lonesome and misunderstood... I've tried to have chats with friends or just get out to give him space but nobody would answer and my car is broken down, so I stayed here... In my head, nobody answered me because I suck to be around lately... I just ruined everything and pushed everyone I had away... I'm 28 y/o and I just started to figure out what I want to do with my life... I feel like I've failed everything but most importantly I failed myself....   


 Instead of burning myself tonight like I would do usually, I'm here... sharing this with you guys, Hoping that somewhere, someone will hear... I know I'm not alone, but why does it feel like I am though....? I don't want t give up... I just don't want to live in pain anymore...

ive felt more social than ever the past few months and know its lexapro related but is it just mania? idek!!!

I was diagnosed with a mood disorder (they say bipolar 1 but I'm skeptical of all doctors- so I went to a new one and he's reevaluating me but medicaid is a bitch and no one cares about me or anyone so I feel at a complete loss) did the whole lithium thing, didn't;t like it, now i'm on lexapro which has made me very hypomanic but in the best way and I LOOOOOVE it, my doc insists I need a mood stabilizer but lamictal made me feel absolutely nothing which as an artist scares the shit out of me, also felt no love or emotion towards my partner/friends/family/ almost felt like suicidal but in an apathetic and non-depressed way (?) so I stopped taking it last week (docs orders) and went into a full blown hypomania where I didn't eat all day, hyper, rushed speech, went out got wasted , started a mosh pit at a concert, couldn't stop blabbering and smiling giddily, it was AWESOME, and puked in the Taco Bell line like a nut. next day hungover but mania was still there,,,, I haven't drank since then (9 days) and have been so (hypo) manic since stopping the lamictal- pacing, heart rate up, blablabla. been taking valium for sleep which helps but oy vey. I just am trying to track these ups and downs and see if it correlates to PMS, to substance use, or eating or whatever but this hyperactivity is still so confusing and inexplicable to doctors because its so FAST to change (3-4 days) and its been going on for about 4 years now --- accompanied with debilitating anxiety and depressive spells. idk man.

I’d like to share my journey so far. 2017 was a very stressful year for me. 2018 kicked off with insomnia, then psychosis, followed by half a year of ups and downs. After I got out of the psychotic episode, I woke up at home not knowing what had happened. I was injected with an anti-psychotic and had to continue taking zyprexa. Over the next few months, when I thought I was getting better, a manic episode would start. 

During mania,
I posted all kinds of weird shit on social media and texted acquaintances strange messages that I had no business doing. I even booked a trip to Japan... right after I got out of my psych’s office. I did not feel that I was doing anything strange but looking back, I was definitely not in the right state of mind. Through those months, my significant other and my family stood by me, watched over me when I didn’t sleep for days, watched over me when I was sleeping and accompanied me on my trips to the hospital. My sister even went with me on my impulse trip to
japan. So did my dad even though I didn’t want him to come along. They were so
afraid that I was going to harm myself or throw myself off a building during mania. Though I didn’t feel that I was suicidal. I became terribly depressed during the down periods, sobbing uncontrollably and telling my SO that I wanted to run away to travel by myself. I recorded what meds I was taking, as a way to track what I was being given. I have a whole physical calendar that tracked what happened on what dates. I kept it so that I can remember what happened and the effects that each type of meds had. 

My mum was literally at the shopping Malls with me till 6am in the morning because I had refused to go home or sleep. 

Thankfully, I was self-employed so I basically stopped work for 8 months. with some money in the bank, I could afford to take a break. So I just relaxed all the way, I read a lot, hung out at cafes by myself and continued taking Lithium until I felt like I didn’t need to anymore. I weaned myself off Lithium (psych didn’t want me to) and it has been a year since I stopped the meds. 

I’m proud to say that I have learned to lead a less stressful life thanks to the whole journey. And I’m Glad that I understand first-hand what other bipolar people go through. I have a new perspective of life and success, I realise that I do not want to be successful that badly and it’s not worth losing my mind over. Maybe I am just not cut out to be a successful business woman or career but I can live with that.

Thank you for sharing all your stories here so that I didn’t feel alone during those days. I know that not everyone is as fortunate to have a good support system or is able to recover so quickly but I would like to share my journey with you so that you know that there is some hope 💕",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94498,public,self,,,Be hopeful,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/enye1b/be_hopeful/,house_only,1

Could a hypomanic episode involve you acting inwards?

By this I mean my brain goes into overdrive and I keep having thoughts and epiphianies about hundreds of things, and I focus on more tasks than one and I word vomit and I feel happy and I can't sleep and everything, but I keep it all to myself. You couldn't tell if I was having a hypomanic episode or a depressive one. And to be honest I'm not even sure if what I'm experiencing can be considering mania or hypomania in general. I mean I've lived my whole life with ups and downs but the ups haven't been high enough to get me hospitalized as much as my downs. It's not even that much of a hindrance I don't think. Sure I can't really think straight but my work ethic and work output is way through the roof. I was able to type out a 7 page book report in just a few days with no notes or a anything. So can a ""disorder"" really even be called a ""disorder"" even if it helps you out sometimes?

What are hypomanic episodes usually like? What should I be expecting or looking out for? I don't feel like I'm losing my mind, I still am aware of my limitations. I'm still quiet and stuff all there really is is just not wanting to sleep and my mind racing so much to the point where I don't know what I'm thinking of. I'm listening to reallh loud music also, mostly because I can't deal with silence. Silence pisses me off when I get like this. Do outside factors determine if it's mania or not? I did have a can of energy drink 15 minutes before this but I don't ususally get this wired honestly. I'm not sure if I'm even happy or not. I feel great but I don't feel ""happy"" happy. I'm still aware of how terrible the world is but it's like my brain isn't letting me feel sad. I have those sad thoughts and it's drowned out by thoughts of random shit like how nootering and declawing are both similat procedures or how I'm aware of how much I'm typing but that in of itself adds to the amount of typing going on by acknoleging this and typing it all out. Do manic episodes help you guys? Do you enjoy your mania or not? How do you deal with the inevidable crash? I equate this to a mountain and how once you reach the top and peak you fall down back to the bottom.

I'm not even sure if this hypomania is even real with me. What if I'm just thinking that I'm hypomanic and in reality I'm completely fine but i'm faking being hypomanic for some reason. I'm always worried of being a hypochondriac and selr diagnosing. I hate it when I do that. I hate myself a lot actually. Is what I'm feeling even hypomania? Or is it just how normal people feel. Do I even belong in this community/group amoung you people? I'm not even diagnosed yet for fucks sake. That seems pretty stupid to me. I'm over hear probably inadvertently trivializing such a serious condition. I'm sorry please forgive me. All I got are questions with no answers. I'm scared of seeking out help because I'd either get shot down or put on some sort of medication that may not even work and will screw up my brain even more if I actually AM faking it and in reality there's nothing really wrong with me.

I should probably be grateful. This maybe hypomania I seem to be experiencing is the only time I'm actually a productive member of society. It's the only time I actually can get stuff done without letting the depression and laziness get in the way. It does get a bit overwhelming though and I sometimes get headaches. I'm not even sure what this post is about anymore. If I am unknowingly faking it i aplologize but if I actually maybe might have it then okay I guess? Not really an accomplishment but at least I'm not a hypochondriac with no actual credit or basis.

Don’t know how to start and what to start with. I’ve always been a mess with almost no insight for years. Been depressive from 15yo and first manic 18-21. I also developed DRDP and severe anxiety with time. I’ve always had racing mind, intrusive thoughts and insomnia since 7yo. 

Having mental issues early i learned how to manage them, hide them, suppress them to some extent. I thought i was doing good. Then last year i have been psychotic and occasionally doing drugs, I couldn’t stand myself being myself, and now i hate myself for doing them as they fooking triggered bad long lasting psychosis. 

This is where i fell apart and it resulted of my partner leaving me with his parents for 3 months while he’s been in a different country. I went to seek help to the psychiatrist and got (for the 4th time) bipolar 1, Depersonalisation and derealisation, signs of OCD. 
I started treatment and medication and life turned 180 for me. 

I suddenly saw myself what i really was. I realised i’ve been hallucinating and was delusional since childhood and that i have huge issues which are hanging as a heavy burden on me and only medication allows me to sleep more or less better. I medicate my pre-sleep anxiety with clonazepam, but all my worst memories (especially connected to my husband), they just haunt me in super realistic dreams. And i sleep at least 10 hours, due to horse size dose of AP and benzos i take. 

Since i was put on meds July last year, i had  a rapid cycling, post-psychotic depression (1,5 month), then a “mild” hypomanic (1,5 months) , with my sleep decreasing to 3 hours, episode followed by 4weeks of depression. During last depression i started mood stabiliser valproate acid, which made me wake up in a good mood, which was funny because i went to sleep depressed and with DRDP symptoms. 

Since then i felt elated, started cooking everyday, baking, doing regulating exercise, rich personal life and general improvement of our relationship and overall life improvement. I thought this is it, i am cured, i found my “health cocktail “, until... 

I started noticing that i am TOO happy. I was bubbly, foamy, dancing flying around. But i was sleeping 11-12 hours a day, so i pushed the idea i could be manic. Right?  But them my husband started acting weird, being aggro at me, like i was the most annoying thing on the planet. Appeared, that i was. He blasted a bucket full of things what he was unhappy about, saying i was a weirdo, that i say things which make everyone cringe and make WTF faces, that i AM annoying and that i am lazy, and that I can’t manage myself and that i am faking everything. He said he is tired of my moodswings, tired of me pretending to be depressed. 

It broke my heart. I already feel disgusted of myself, but before that speech, i never really was suicidal. I never thought, that i would ever be. I understand why he said it. I get it, it is a shot work to deal with me, when even I cannot contorl or analyse myself. I am also unemployed, so he paid for my psych visits, for my meds, and while being angry he announced his position on me “draining hundreds of dollars on my ATTENTION SEEKING”. 

But meds kept me up to the moods and benzos made me “not think” about it and my upped mood kept on going, putting me in more exercise, more cooking, more cleaning, and Xmas+NY holidays were full of things to do. 

However, i had several breakdown moments when i was just so randomly overwhelmed with the shit that my brain brings up and makes me think about it, makes me hate myself, hate my husband, everyone around and just make me want to not live anymore. To be forgotten and just step into void. 

I think i started hallucinating again. I keep seei gthese shadows, flashes of people walking (who are def not there), some of the sounds are not real, i know it). I haven’t had hallucinations since i started seroquel in july, so now i can tell what is not real. The only thing i dunno if real is me. I dont know who i am anymore, i keep seeing bugs everywhere but i think it is normal, many people do that. 

I have been untreated and nor accepting my diagnosis for 4 years and maybe my hubby is right and if i still didn’t take meds, i would be the fucked up version of me, but still me. Because I don’t know if i am not fake. I don’t think i bipolar. I am studying online but i can’t focus or connect words together. 

TL; DR. 
Summing up. I decIDED to speak less, because i am afraid of people saying i a freak. I am takin benzos everyday to stop intrusive thoughts and memories. I don’t pay attention to “possibly” hallucinations. I am pretending to be good by keeping myself busy with sport or cooking, because i am afraid my husband will accuse me of my behaviour again/him paying for me being fucked up. I deeply, truly hate the whole being of myself.

For the first time since then I feel like I'm finally getting better, finally enjoying life because of the things happening around me and not just my illness, finally being able to say what's real and what's not. Just a few months ago things had gotten so bad I had lost all hope. I was convinced that there was nothing left for me and that this was just a dead end life. In a depressive episode, I had stopped eating for days or getting out of my room and I was close to losing my strength and ending my life. I was just so tired of trying different things all with no success, tired of living with this constant emotional rollercoaster with no one to talk too and no one to support me.

During this episode my family took me against my will at that time to my local hospital where I was immediately put on different medication and put in touch with community services. About a week later I started to feel ""normal"" again but I assumed this was just a mood cycle. Well it's been several months and here I am, still alive and before you today. It's been a long road and I can't even begin to explain how good I feel. I don't mean the hypomanic kind of good either, I mean the genuine kind of good. The kind where you finally feel like your life has worth, the kind where your finally ready to face challenges again and the kind where you care for the whole world again. Just a few weeks ago I had my first good dream in two years and the feeling I had waking up to it made me feel the best I've felt in my life. For the first time in years I had hope again. 

The part about all of this that still breaks my heart is that people today feel the way I did back then and there is nothing I can do for any of them. ""I can say things will get better, believe me!"" but truth be told in that time I'm sure I wouldn't have believed anyone saying that. So to anyone out there I know it seems like you're the outlier and your pain may feel unbearable but I promise you, You too will one day have that event that makes you feel hope again. It won't be perfect, I can't lie and say it will be. Mental health is a marathon and I still deal with panic disorder and stuff but it doesn't matter anymore, my strength to continue has been renewed and I hope yours will be to. If there's ever anyone who needs to talk or is in a dark place I'm here for you. That's also a promise.

My husband is 34yo who has cancer. We are going to our first couples counselling today and I am hella nervous. I feel like all the blame is gonna be put on me because I can't seem to enjoy or want intimate time with him. Not just sex, I find it hard to kiss or even cuddle. It's been a real issue since my husband's diagnoses in November 2018. In the beginning I had to care for him and do everything for him while he went for surgery then radiation and chemo which was very very hard on him. During that time I had a mental breakdown from Dec 2018 - March 2019. My psychiatrist at the time was leaning towards schizophrenia related symptoms but my new psychiatrist (who is much better and actually listens) believes it to be bipolar and cptsd. 
My husband would say we have no problems except sex.
I would say we have many more underlying issues. Like some of his symptoms post surgery trigger my cptsd like his screaming and yelling. It's not usually directed at me but even being around it sends me back in time and I start to spiral in self hatred and guilt. Then there is the fact I took care of him for 8 months or longer where he treated me like his caregiver or mother. Not that he could really control it but he was like a child (and in some ways still is). Not able to speak properly, needing even the smallest things done for him like wiping his mouth while eating, and having temper tantrums. Which really sucked any intimacy I could have had right out of me. I feel like I am stuck in caregiver mode and even though he is doing much much better now when he does act like a child I then get triggered back to my mental breakdown when it was like watching him die right before my eyes. Which then once he was getting better we started to drink. And I drank heavily for most of 2020 - everyday - blacking out a handful of times a week (this isn't totally unusual for me) So now I am in recovery per my therapists request. I've also cut out weed. 

I feel like I am trying so so hard to be the happy version of me but it feels like the only times I've been happy over the last ten years have been hypomania or mania. I don't want my husband to have to spend the rest of his short life with this miserable unloving wife. But I also wish he saw his part in it, and how my mental illness is a part of that just like his cancer is a part of him. 

Has anyone else had these problems? How did it resolve? Is it really all on me to make things better? Is this a thing with my medications that needs changing? (My medications are: Venlafaxine 300mg/abilify 15mg/Trazadone 100mg/wellbutrin 150mg/ + clonazepam for emergencies)

I'm on Seroquel as part of my medicine cocktail, a 50mg fast acting version to be taken at night, etc etc.  My other meds include Rexulti and Lamictal, Klonopin as needed. 

I ofc know that alcohol is something I shouldn't really partake in given the potential trigger (or at least I'm told, I've never been much of a drinker if I'm honest) and the fact that it's not quite recommended I do so with the meds I take. I've asked my psychiatrist if I can and it was recommended I don't, like it says on the pill bottle. 

So my question is: what if I do? Anyone else on these meds (Seroquel is the main concern) or has been on it and drank alcohol during the time? 

(I do realize this is potentially a very bad idea, given the other bad things I've started and have become dependent on for coping, but you know, if I'm gonna do it I wanna know the risks. My psychiatrist said the issue is with slowed down breathing, which yes ok, fair, but other than that? I'm admittedly possibly/probably having a bit of a mixed episode and rn it's self destructive o'clock. I'm gonna spend a couple nights with some friends and a few drinks seem like fun. I'm not really interested in partaking in weed since I know that would definitely show up in drugs tests and I don't wanna deal with that fall out. Mainly I'm just really, really sad and wanna just go crazy, go stupid.)

**Question 1:** From the time you started seeking clinical/medical treatment, how long did it take you to get the proper diagnosis?

I don't know if I am BP2 or anything else, but I feel like GAD and depression are a symptom of something else at this point. My moods have been extremely high and extremely low this year worse than ever before.

That there is a way to deal with this life encompassing issue.

People unlike us, they do not understand.

We fluctuate between two places in life [atleast I do]
My two moods are ""I'm the best"" and ""I'm the worst why haven't they given you the electric chair ""

So when things get real bad in my head I hop on reddit and talk to whomever about whatever they have an issue with. Sometimes people just need a place to vent and I am an amazing listener.

I'm secretly looking for someone to have the same problems as me, but they have the knowledge and words to explain it. Which unfortunately I currently lack the introspection to even begin to fathom figuring that out on my own.

I am not by any means using this post to set up myself as a pillar of the community. But we all get sad, so if you're bored and sad, it would help me if we spoke for a little. 

Especially if anyone's feeling lonely. 

Just pop in and say hi.

But what I was getting at with this whole post is that I did it guys. 
I havent had a career in almost 10 years. Everything else has been shitty jobs or unemployment.
But I was just about to give up the other day and I got the call (3months) after the interview.
Since being homeless about 2 years ago it's been painful and lonely and dangerous (robbed more than I'd care to share) but I'm still here. 

TLDR
I choosing to take the negative in my life and turn it into a positive. I absolutely refuse to let anyone (especially my mood disorder) fuck my life up.

Every day I have to remind myself to not clench my teeth (I shattered 4 molars this year from stress grinding) 
I have to constantly manage my walking speed and seating position and patterns of speech because nobody tells you when you're being manic, they just secretly laugh behind closed doors.

Fuck that. Real homies talk shit to your face but talk good when you're not there. 

Mind who you surround yourself with, youd be surprised at how easily a negative influence can suck you in. And just as quickly a positive influence can do the same.

I'm not jesus. I'm not a messiah. I'm just a really emotionally fucked up person (I have bipolar on sodium and calcium receptors which is the first case that severe any of my doctors have seen)

But I'd like to start a group chat or something where people can be positive and share good ideas and show off their work and progress and shit like that.

Normally, I wouldn't rush things, but he's slightly younger than me and wants at least one kid. I'm pushing 40 and my fertility is not exactly at it's peak. We have agreed mainly to date for marriage purposes, but it's stressful because of the other obstacles.

If I were younger, this wouldn't be as bad, but I'm already advanced maternal age. This needs to happen quickly if it's going to happen at all. 

I'm overwhelmed by it all, but I can't express it to him because he just gets upset that I'm unhappy. He can clearly see I'm miserable, but if I share my concerns with really valid issues, he tells me not to worry about it. When I stress about having to go off my meds to have the child and what that will look like, he just says his mother will move in to help.

I'm not obligated to tell him because I don't have an official lease. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also I will be severing all contact with him after I move.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros to telling him:

1. Maybe I get a rise out of him and a genuine expression of emotion or remorse at the way he's treated me the last year, with the dream being that he feels bad and wants to fix it.
2. He can prepare his daughter for me to move, because she now calls me her second mommy and says I love you when she goes to bed, school, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: 

1. That isn't likely to happen.
2. I'd have to watch him not give a shit for three more weeks. That would hurt me. What if that resulting bad feeling makes me want to cling to him more for comfort? (I have an anxious attachment style.)
3. Maybe if he just comes home from work one day and I'm gone, it will make him at least evaluate his life choices and perhaps seek the help that he needs for himself.
4. He may try to sleep with me again for old times sake, and every single time we sleep together it sets me back. But I am almost a slave to my sex drive for this guy so I don't want to give him the opportunity to be a disappointing human being \*again\* by knowing this and trying to sleep with me. Also if he knows, what if I end up breaking first and want to sleep with him? (see anxious attachment style)
5. It will hurt his daughter a lot and she's too young to understand why I would need to do this (she is 7)

&amp;#x200B;

I know that it doesn't matter to him whether I tell him or not, and logically the best thing for me is obviously to just leave without telling him and be gone, to save myself hurt. So why do I still want to tell him and hope that he magically wakes up and wants to work on himself? 

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like it's a self-preserving type of behavior but I also don't feel good for hoping that it hurts him a little.",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94553,public,self,,,Am I being impulsive?

A few weeks ago I posted about running out of lithium and feeling like I was falling apart a bit. Well, I got a refill a day or two after that post but things haven't got much better. I'm no longer at my parents' place, which is a plus, but god I am barely functional. My boyfriend has to physically pull me out of bed most days to make sure I'm up before noon and can get to my scheduled rehearsals (I'm a conservatory student). I'm just doing the absolute bear minimum to get by, because doing anything feels excruciating, like I'm just hyper-aware of my own inadequacy. I hate feeling like everyone thinks I'm pathetic or don't care. I can't actually remember the last time I worked as hard as I want to on anything without being burned out after 5 minutes. Working with my colleagues makes me want to climb out of my skin because I can't focus with all this haze in my head and I have to spend several hours a day being professionally polite to someone who aggressively harassed and bullied me. How am I supposed to be productive when looking at them just fills my brain with their voice telling me I'm an incompetent idiot who half-asses everything I do?

I've been obsessively working out to try and feel productive, but otherwise I feel like I'm trapped in this cloud of endless self-hatred where everything is my fault for not being able to shut up and get on with it, and then I just hate myself more for all the self-pity.

I want to schedule my therapist but the sound of my own voice freaks me out too much to call and I've convinced myself I'm just taking valuable resources from more deserving people.

 I’m fairly new to this subreddit so I apologize if this is the wrong place for this.

So over the last 8 months I have gained a tremendous amount of weight without trying (and not necessarily eating large amounts). While my mental health is considerably better, I’m really insecure about my new experience and my self worth has gone down. I know diet and exercise can change this if I work hard, and this is mostly just a rant, but it really sucks things had to go this way. I feel like I’ll never find someone who loves me for me through all of this mental health shit.

Happy days that suddenly turn sour. Anger at people I love for no reason. I have used alcohol during this time too to try to suppress the feelings. I’m not proud.

My friend thinks I might be bipolar. I was raised that this wasn’t real. That my dad had me diagnosed young and I don’t have it, but my friend suggested I follow this thread and maybe post on it. Of course, when I was comfortable.

In the last 4 weeks I’ve had the following happen:

- I lost my job (on my birthday)
- my boyfriend slept with a woman who had been coming between us for 3 years
- I didn’t get a final check from my job 
- my parents (who’ve always been mean about this kind of thing) pretty much said suck it up, grow up, figure it all out

I don’t know how to feel. I have days where I can’t move, but I have days where I take three showers. 

I just want to feel comfortable again. I want to understand.",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94586,public,self,,,Hello All,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/eobfwz/hello_all/,house_only,1

I really dont want to loose him. I havent spoken to him in so long. I dont want to love him forever and never see him, I feel like my life is ruined, I really only want him. I dont need him to be happy but I really dont have any interest in another person and u cant find any answer but to wait and try to get over him and hope he comes back before I move on.

I told my dad that I’ve been writing and journaling for a year, so when I read more about bipolar I went back and read my journals and could see a lot of things that were kind of red flags and things made sense. 

He ended up saying that he’s proud of me anyway and asking what my plans are for treatment, so it ended on a positive note.

I was already anxious that day. We didn’t have any work to do and it was a slow day with us trying to find busy work to do. I asked my manager if my team could go to the game room and do some team building, and he said yes. Another manager near my manager said his team was in there, but we were welcome to join them. I didn’t know they were there, and I didn’t know the people on that team. I let them both know I was already anxious and interacting with people I didn’t know would be too much for the level my anxiety was at. My manager knows I have panic attacks triggered by social interactions and knowing people are looking at me. He knows I have an eating disorder that sometimes makes me believe everyone who looks at me thinks I’m fat and disgusting. I was struggling with that that day because my team lead said “carbies don’t make barbies” and I couldn’t get it out of my head. Despite knowing most of that he told my other team mates to force me to go. I asked him again to give me another project, but he again told someone to force me to go interact with the other team. It made me feel trapped and made the anxiety worse. After me begging a second time almost crying to let me do something else where I didn’t have to interact with strangers, to go back to trying to find something relating to my job to do, he finally let me go back to my desk. It would have been different if it was a work related task he was asking me to do. I would have done that no matter how anxious I was. This was playing video games to take a break from work. When I got back to my desk I received and email from him that he, the other managers, and everyone who heard thought I was being a snob and was being unacceptably rude. That’s when I stopped being able to breathe. I had tried really hard to explain myself so they wouldn’t think I was being rude.  I responded that I was so so sorry, that it wasn’t my intention to be rude or a snob, that I just knew where my anxiety level was at and I knew what I couldn’t handle interacting with strangers at the time. I told him I could feel a panic attack coming after receiving his email, and that I was going to the bathroom to try to control it. I still couldn’t breath and fell down when I got to the bathroom. I have bruises on my knees from collapsing when I got to the bathroom. My chest hurt and my hands were so numb I couldn’t feel them. When I could stand up I went to my desk to clock out and go home early. But I was still having trouble breathing and was gasping for air when I got to my desk. My teammates heard me and crowded around me to find out what was wrong, which made it worse and I felt claustrophobic. I took a Clonazepam because I couldn’t think of what else to do. At that point my manager came over and tried to talk to me. I was barely able to tell him I could couldn’t breath and couldn’t talk. Then I walked out of the building and sat in my car and called my parents. They talked me down enough to make the 30 minute drive home. It was awful. I have to go back into work tomorrow for the first time since this incident. I work Sunday through Thursday. I’m afraid I will have another attack when I walk in the building.

I take meds for my BP and nightmares.

I didn’t know which flair to exactly put on but I figured this best since it does include suicidal thoughts. 

I ran out of my meds while my mom was in the hospital (she was in the hospital for about 2 weeks) and so I haven’t been able to really sleep or take my meds and I feel like I’m going crazy.

I’ve been medicated for about 6 months now on the same meds so I’ve gotten used to the routine and adjusted to my meds but now I don’t have my meds and had to move into a completely new house.  There’s been so much change and rough stuff going on and it doesn’t help that I can’t really do anything because no one has custody atm so I can’t get my meds. And dealing with the grief. I’ve started drinking again to help cope and I mean it works for 2 hours and then I go back to spiraling and being so depressed that I’m even starting to get worried. I keep writing suicide notes and planning it and even almost self harmed. The only reason I didn’t was because I just kept imagining like my mom was right next to me and even though I know she’s dead, I just think that if I did it would destroy her. I still haven’t accepted that she’s dead either. 

I keep going through periods of where I will cry for hours and then being so happy and I don’t know where it’s coming from either because my mood swings aren’t like that and it’s really scaring me because it feels like I’m in completely unknown territory and I have nobody else in my life that really understands bipolar and I’m so scared of telling the person that I’m currently living with that I have it because I don’t want her to think I’m crazy and not let me stay. I’m terrified. 

Well, the whole point of that information  was me asking you guys, who are older and may have gone through similar things; how did you deal with grief? How did you get through it? Because I’m out of options and since I’m about to graduate and haven’t been accepted to any colleges, everything just seems so dim because I have zero future.it feels like the only way out is to kill myself and I just don’t know what to do. I am open to every piece of advice I can get. I know that I should go back to a mental hospital but I really don’t want to. The only place that I can really go to doesn’t actually help- the last time I went I was there for a month and only saw a therapist/psychiatrist maybe 3 times.

The thing is, I started dating a guy three weeks ago and it’s been going amazing, too good to be true. We’re inseparable. When we’re not together we’re texting or on the phone for long hours. He told me he’s falling in love with me already and I know he’s genuine. He can’t stop talking about how great I am, how I have the best personality, how pretty I am, how he’s so lucky to have me, how he can’t believe I’m actually “his”.. etc. This guy idolizes me. And he’s an amazing person himself. Really amazing in all aspects. I’ve never felt more loved or appreciated. 

Couple of days ago he travelled for work and won’t be back until next week. Today I feel like I’m starting to experience mild hypomania. It’s 10 AM where I am and I haven’t slept yet and I’m about to start my day. I’m not ready yet to tell him about my bipolar diagnosis. So please don’t suggest that, I hope you respect my choice. It will happen when the time is right. What I’m mainly concerned about is not to appear weird over text/phone calls because he knows how I behave in text and calls when I’m not hypomanic. I can’t stay away from the phone for couple of days because he’ll be too worried or suspicious, we chat on WhatsApp all day long and have at least 1 one hour phone call. It’s just the honeymoon phase so please don’t judge. I’m already feeling like I’m getting weird, and I’m worried he’ll realise I’m weird, that he’ll suddenly out of the blue disappear or stop caring about me and  figure out that I’m a scam. I feel like my experience of reality is a bit altered and that all the feelings we had for each other these past weeks are a fraud and he’ll realize that. I don’t know what to do. Right now I’m just pretending that I’m still asleep to not text him back. I still feel love for him but I’m afraid to be myself. Im afraid that I’ll be too much or too weird, even though he’s VERY expressive and affectionate. Im afraid I’ll say too many wrong/weird things and he’ll suddenly stop seeing me the way he did in past. 

In the past couple of years my hypomania typically lasts for couple of days with no psychotic symptoms, except for a rare particular one which lasted like a full week and I was experiencing a full blown psychosis.

I think this hypomania will be manageable. I’m just don’t know how to shake this “weird” feeling.. and the feeling that I’ll come off as weird.

I don't keep a scale in my house for the same reason I hate knowing how much I weigh the only reason I know is because I had my follow up appt and that's the scale I've been going off of.. anyway I have had zero motivation about working out even I think about it daily but that won't do shit obviously. I just need 30 minutes to an hour and I can't even put in the work. 

I've been in a little funk in the last week and Friday was a super shitty day my sister told me she's going to BK because if a fucking car accident she put herself in (99% her fault, she didn't have the right away but the other guy was speeding, or so she says) she didn't have car insurance and my husband co-signed for her.🤦🏽‍♀️ We were planning to pay off our debt this year to buy a house in 2. My scores are in the 700s despite having so much debt but it's cuz of the skills I acquired with my job paying my boss's bills. I know how to juggle them. I think we should BK too but I'm scared. A that hard work I have applied for several 0% interest cards and transferred balances. I don't know what to do there. 

And then here's the kicker. Awhile back I decided to buy some sex toys because well every now and then I'm hypersexual and I decide I need to masturbate more than once a day to help curve it. 🤦🏽‍♀️ I also bought them after a fight with my husband so I guess that wasn't a good idea. Well I bought a dildo along with a vibrator and some butt stuff and welp let's just say the dildo is slighty bigger than I should've bought. Now, although I'm hypersexual I was still a little insecure about showing these things to my husband. I would say about a month ago I brought out the vibrator and it was amazing, he enjoyed, I especially enjoyed it. Sometimes it's hard for me to get there with him because I am always overthinking instead of being in the moment and enjoying it. When we were done I had the confidence to tell him about the plug but not the dildo. So going back to Friday he found the empty box where the dildo was and now he's upset I hid it. I tried to talk to him about it what would be Saturday night now but he just shut me out and went upstairs to bed. I bawled my fucking eyes out and have been downstairs since. He compared it to the time I hid smoking weed from him a year ago (been sober now going on 3 months) but this is not remotely the same thing.At least I don't see it that way. I want to spice up our sex life. Of course, I could've been a little more conservative when choosing one but I remember being angry when I bought it so I wasn't paying attention to how big it was.

Saturday morning I can tell he was distant but I wasn't sure how to bring it up. I don't know if I should bring it up this Sunday morning again. And honestly right now all I can think about is masturbating because again hypersexual. 🤦🏽‍♀️ Also, I haven't used that fucking thing because it is genuinely too big. I probably should've return it. 🤷🏽‍♀️ But that's me being passive aggressive again. Why should I return it now. I get that he doesn't like that I hid it from him but when would have been the right time to pull out a giant fucking dildo. 😐 Fuck. I really need to go to bed now. It's literally taken me half an hour to type this shit out.

I got about 3 hours of sleep because my routine was messed up then had to spend the rest of the day in a coffee shop until work yesterday night. On my drive home my usual way was iced over so my dad tried to explain a new way to get home but it was rapid fire instructions and he didn’t understand why I couldn’t just remember them. Finally we worked it out, I was going to start the usual way home, but instead of my exit keep straight, merge onto I-xx and follow the signs to CITY NAME. Well I kept going, and going, and going with no signs showing. So I text him 3 takes asking if I still want to be on I-XX and he kept saying yes, yes, just follow directions. So I keep going. After driving 2 hours he calls to see where I’m at, I’ve driven 30 miles past my exit which was not CITY NAME, but a completely different city name. Now I’ve been driving on snow and ice for 3.5 hours and my nerves are rekt, I start having a panic attack. When I get home I kind of recluse and sleep 10 hours. 

I woke up with very little spoons and another icy trip to work looming and it’s been one little thing after another. We were out of coffee so I have to have tea, The dog started barking out back at the neighbors during her potty break and wouldn’t listen like normal to come in so I had to run out barefoot to drag her in, slipping on the snow so I spilled tea over my comfort hoodie. I had to shower in the “kids” shower that had a light shower curtain that kept blowing out and touching me (again low spoons and touch is overwhelming). My mom has been running the washer and my parents had showered so half way through my shower my water ran over cold. Getting out everything hit me and I started to have another panic attack. 

So here I am, wet and still in my towel, sitting at the foot of my (still unmade) bed crying. I’m mad I can’t be “normal” and brush it off. Seeing it all written down I can see these are such little things but it’s 10am and I’m already overwhelmed and emotionally exhausted. I keep trying to tell myself to be kind and accept this is how my brain works and feel my feelings but I am stuck in these cyclical thoughts of invalidating my pain and exhaustion and trying to fight my emotions instead of letting them ruin their course and embracing them without feeling like I’ve been so good at lately. I feel like I’ve taken 10 steps back just because a little storm has changed my routine.

There’s definitely been times I didn’t want to take meds, and too many times I’ve stopped them; but I couldn’t place why. I knew with bipolar it’s pretty notorious to not want to take meds, but I just kept hearing that same reason.

But I feel like when I’m on meds my emotions and creativity are better- at least more polished. It’s the only time I can think and feel clearly. Whether manic or depressed, my experiences feel so blurred and blunted it’s like a fog. Even if I’m euphoric, I still feel really confused (I just don’t care about it at the time.)

I think I’ve finally figured out my personal aversions:

1. Despite all logical evidence against it- I still sometimes see hypo/mania as a “superpower.” Even though I’ve now had probably about equal dysphoric and euphoric manias, at the beginning it was all euphoric for me. During them I accomplished a lot, and even though I can point out that nothing I did actually *went* anywhere afterwards- when I have a lot to do I still find myself thinking “Man, it’d be handy to be manic right now.” Now I can remind myself that even the most euphoric manias I’ve had ended in psychosis and hospitalization. Not good tools for accomplishment lol.

2. Deep-rooted self stigma. No matter how much of a mental health advocate I consider myself, it’s still there. It probably is for most of us. The idea of not being “normal.” The ideas of “maybe I just made it all up,” “maybe I’m cured now.” But knowing it’s there helps me fight it much easier than just ignoring it.

I’m glad I finally realized these things, I hope with them I can finally stay on my meds this time. I don’t think I can resolve my feelings completely, but now I can talk myself out of stopping meds with more personal logic and reasoning than just “you know you shouldn’t.”

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a Bible for many years, but I have barely read anything from it. My grand father and grand mother however are christians, they never really talked about it with me. But last time I was visiting them I noticed that they have an entire collection of different bibles in their book collection, some dating back 100s of years even. I found a particular interest in that since it was so beautiful and unique, but it was harder to read due to the older language.

Anyway, at the dinner table my grand father started talking about how they changed some quotes during mass if I understood it correctly and that he didn't like it since the meaning sort of changed. At that point I asked him if he's actually religious to which he replied that we are all religious. I didn't ask him to elaborate on that statement, he's somewhat of a mine field when it comes to asking questions etc. it can become rather intense discussions very easily in some topics. But knowing him he didn't imply that we're all christians, just religious, and there are a bunch of different religions and beliefs.

Anyway, where I'm from it's extremely rare to encounter religious people, or at least so I thought since nobody really talks about it. So it could be more common than I think. Personally I suppose I believed in God as a child (I remember being like five years old and thinking I could build a sand tower high enough to reach God. Absurd, I know, which I realized pretty quickly, regular sand is a poor construction material.) I don't know when, but somewhere that notion disappeared and a part from that I've always considered myself agnostic. Never an atheist, it's a foolish claim to me (I apologize if anyone takes offense to this) since it's pretty definitive and nobody knows what happens in the after life. Let alone that there are no creator(s), albeit the creator(s) might not be what is portrayed in the abrahamitic religions. Humans can create a terrible amount of things, so surely there's a possibility of a more advanced being creating whatever we live in and us. Ironically enough I found most religious (in an active way) people at the university. Didn't see that one coming, oh well.

I assume that there's a majority of americans on here (maybe poor assumption, but from what I've read it appears to be the case) and I know that religion is quite prevalent in the US still, and I wanted to know if there are any religious people here (primarily christians, but jewish or muslim people feel free to answer as well since it's the same god.) And if so, does anyone feel that the book helps you in this battle against our inner demons?

This question stems from the fact that my grand father told me to read the bible and come back to him after I asked him something about it. He didn't want to discuss or push any ideas on me but instead that I should read it and make my own interpretation. It should be noted that he also have the ""struggles"", but take no medication for it. And I guess I always had an interest in it, just never got into it really (I didn't get a bible for nothing).

I let him know my antidepressants have really helped the outlook of my life. He then says, “I think people who take medicine are weak.

I wasn’t really sure what to say about that and I felt as if he doesn’t understand the struggles I’ve been through or how bad I can get.

Anyway, I spent ten years in manic episode the majority of the time. This was me...4-7 days awake and manic...then a day or two crashed...repeat for ten years. When I say that I will go 7 days awake and never stop moving, I mean this in the most literal way. Twice I went 9 days, awake and never stopping. My brain was fried, brain function was non existent...I had entire days I wouldn't remember and things I would remember that never happened. Terrible feeling like I was losing my mind. Once we got my sleep issue better (only took ten years🙄) which means I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep regularly, my brain started having some improvement. Now it's been 3 years, I've had one manic episode and some hypomanic issues a couple times which was minor for me compared to my past but my brain function has never been the same.

I'm so scatterbrained, I feel so stupid. I used to be really smart, had a great career in a science field and I did my job to perfection. Now I don't know if I'm coming or going. I get lost in parking lots! I just cry. I can't follow more than two instructions at a time and that's an improvement. I can't answer broad questions...I freeze and panic and then feel stupid. I do some online dating to meet people and the first thing ""what do you like to do?"" ...simple question...I freeze ...way too broad, my brain immediately goes to all the possibilities, even all the things I might like but never tried so I say that I don't know...who doesn't know?? Stupid. I require more direct questions. Where do I want to eat? Anxieties in overdrive because I'm trying to not appear stupid...give me a list of options and I can do that. I get frustrated so quickly and then I can't see anything clearly and I just cry because I feel so dumb.

Does anyone else have this brain function problem??

He told me that I have to promise that if I sign up I have to go 4 times a week at least, I told him I want to, and I don't want to waste his money, but I can't control if I become depressed and can't go, but I will make efforts and do the best I can.
But it's not good enough and my chance for happiness is not worth 150$ (our family has enough money to pay without worry).
Idk how to explain it better to him, I literally admitted I have depression which is something I very rarely bring up, I love him but he has no idea what it's like.
He then said ""go on make me the bad guy here"" but as I was on the verge of crying and just don't enjoy those fights I told him he is not the bad guy and went to my room to almost* have a break down.
But it's true, he is not a bad guy and I love him, he just lives in his own world.

So the army is more important then me 🙃

I’ve had several friends that are bipolar, including my best friend with bipolar 1, but I’ve noticed the two are very different and the condition can affect a romantic relationship quite differently. I have yet to be diagnosed with some personal mental issues for myself as well, so most of time, it’s extremely hard for me to be a genuinely uplifting person for him. However, I have an advocate personality type so I’m always trying to help people, especially those I love and care about. all I want is to help him. some days are worse than others, but at least two weeks of the month he’ll experience low lows, and I don’t know how to effectively respond to them... but I feel like I’ve tried everything. it gets to the point of him saying he’s “going to do it”, which led us to this most recent hospitalization. he will become irritable and tell me I don’t understand how it feels, which is hard because I know while I haven’t been diagnosed bipolar - I have certainly experienced suicidal ideations almost daily for several years now. I lost a close friend a year and a half ago to suicide who was bipolar, so I have a decent understanding of the severity of this illness. I also completely understand not wanting to carry on and as much as I try and talk him down, a huge piece of me agrees with most of the things he’s saying regarding this “sick world”. he tells me our relationship isn’t enough to help anything, and me being the extremely sensitive fucker I am, takes everything he says to heart even though I know he’s not thinking straight during these episodes. I never tell him this because I know it would make him feel worse - I never look the other way or ignore him when he is upset, I am always empathetic and caring towards him through the lows, but sometimes I just don’t know what to do. all I want is to help him through this. He is on Prozac, which is probably way too weak to be truly doing anything. He also sees a therapist once a week, tries to exercise, meditates, and participates in other personal hobbies as well. it’s not like heNs not trying...he is a wonderful person, I love him and I know he means well and is very caring and genuine, but the bipolar and anxiety/depression comorbidity makes everything extremely difficult. getting a job has been challenging for him, and he is extremely introverted so it’s very hard to shift him from his comfort zone. part of me feels like i’m just not the right person for him, like I should be more stable and upbeat to truly help him through this.  but, we’ve discussed it before, and our bond is so strong we feel like we can overcome these challenging moments through time. I could never give up on him, not for something like this. I have been researching a lot and attempting to begin to understand his symptoms so I don’t take the irritability to heart, and so that I can attempt to be the best possible for him and his recovery. I don’t know, I have no one to talk to about this kind of thing because no one would understand, but maybe someone here could help point me in a good direction? this is hard to explain for me but thank you if you read this &lt;3

After laying out all of the details, he told me that what I’ve described to him is Bipolar II.  It was a bit of a jolt at first, but after being honest with myself, I certainly didn’t help myself earlier on, as I saw all of my other psychiatrists as a teenager, and at that point in my life didn’t trust them, and thus I didn’t answering questions the right way, fearing one wrong answer would land me in the hospital. I further compounded that by not going since living on my own and having my own insurance because I either couldn’t afford it or didn’t think talking would help. I just recently figured out I had sleep apnea, and before that had insomnia. While the Dr wasn’t sure, he said mental fog caused by sleep issues could have masked other symptoms. I’m also thankful this Dr I saw tries to keep prescriptions for a minimum, and reduced the number of things I take and has gotten me stuff that will treat bipolar II better.

I’ve tried Lexapro (for two months), Zoloft (for a week), Effexor (for a month), and Pristiq (for a week). Wellbutrin and Buspar stopped working after two years. Currently I’ve been on Trintellix since before thanksgiving. My psychiatrist prescribed it to me. I feel tired, unmotivated, and a general sense of feeling down. It’s an awful feeling. I couldn’t even enjoy Christmas. I still have terrible anxiety. I told him all of this at my appointment this past Thursday. He acted like it was working. He said I seemed fine. I was wearing makeup and I wasn’t crying, that’s why I seemed fine. You’d think a psychiatrist would be able to understand that just because a patient can appear fine for an appointment, it doesn’t mean they’re actually fine.

He ended up doubling my Trintellix dose (from 10 mg to 20 mg), added Rexulti (0.5 mg for three days, then up to 1 mg), and continued with my Adderall XR 30 mg. I feel even more tired now. I still have anxiety. I know it’s only been a few days but I knew this would happen and he didn’t believe me. It’s so invalidating. I want to try Parnate because it seems like despite the risky side effects, it really works. I’m okay with not eating or taking certain things if that means I’m not sleepy and depressed. I don’t get how an MAOI is any riskier than an antipsychotic. I would literally rather be back on Wellbutrin than feel as shitty as I do right now. At least Wellbutrin didn’t make me feel worse.

Futhermore, I insulted her for having bad tastes and not respescting mine. For a very long while, I thought the problem was hers, because I had not asked for a gift, it was given to me, and it didn't even reflect my needs and tastes at the time. Instead of expressing it with diplomacy, I guess my anxiety, untreated bipolar and the fact that I would close myself to any attempt of intrusion in my life by others (feeling unstable and insecure), made me behave like the worst asshole ever. It took time to realize I was ""at fault"" or at least ""my symptoms were at fault"". Since the incident, she decided we weren't invited anymore to family events and I would not visit my father as mush as I wanted. I only saw him once or twice a year, whereas in the past I'd saw him every two weeks...

I am now what I would call a ""recovering"" bipolar, because my Lamictal treatment is really doing wonders. And even in the worst times that I am going through at the moment, I hang in there and always see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have been stable for a year, and haven't had a SH relapse since last May, which is huge for me and my psych.

Anyways, I went to my father's last week end (we live 4 hours from each other) and in the morning, my father went out to buy bread (my in laws are frenchies lol), I sneaked out the house, got in the car and asked if we could stop on the way to get flowers for his wife. I didn't think a second about the price, I just bought the most beautiful roses I found. I even remembered my mother in law was uncomfortable with white roses since her brother's passing, and mentionned it to the florist. When we got home, I joyfully greeted everyone with a ""Good morning all, we brought breakfast, good morning to you, France (let's call her that since she's french lol), I brought you flowers ! "". She didn't see it coming AT ALL and was obviously moved. At first, she thought it came from my father so she thanked him, but my father corrected her and told her I had waken up early to get the flowers myself. You should have seen that poker face ""what am I gonna do with this ungrateful bitch who now offers me flowers ?"".

We had breakfast, had cigarettes and coffee and talked for a little while before going to the restaurant. I told both of them (my father and my mother in law), it would be my pleasure to split the note and at least pay for drinks. My mother in law refused. I was a little bit sad and told her timidly ""but this is how I show affection, I always invite my loved ones for drinks..."". She briefly mentioned the elders should always pay for the youngest ones as it was tradition in her family. I let her finish and since she sheemed quite resentful, I told her this : ""I am very sorry my ungrateful behaviour hurt you years ago. I inherited this bipolar nightmare from my mother \[who committed suicide seven years ago\] and I know I am unpredrictable and a restless bitch at times, it comes and goes with my illness. But I have been under treatment for over a year now, I feel better and more stable than ever. I apologize for anything you might have misinterpreted or that might have hurt you, I am sorry in advance it might happen again, but please realize you are a blessing in my father's life, we (my brothers and I) are grateful for everything you do for him and are relieved you have found happiness together. Please, please, let me offer you a present from time to time"". 

She cried like a 2 year old lol. She mentionned not understanding all the aspects of the illness my mother suffered from and the symptoms I showed as well (especially since it is super hard to tell when you're manic or depressed or rapid cylcing at the precise moment you're going through it), but I guaranteed her I had it way more under control than my mother did (she refused the diagnosis and went untreated with no therapy for years), I was able to complete my studies, keep a job. All it needed was a little understanding and patience on both parts, and it would go smoothly. She insisted I communicated more so she understand better with time and I could understand her better as well, I told her I often refrain myself from communicating as to not express strong emotions that I might be processing at the precise moment the person is trying to communicate, but I would definitely try and be as clear as possble about my feelings. After that she seemed so much more at peace and she even let me pay the drinks at the restaurant. 

I am going back to my father's next week, and have already prepared a little gift for her (nothing special, just a mug with their wedding picture printed on it). Since we had been distant for a while, I thought it'd be a reminder to her that she's a a wonderful gift to my father and I am so happy they are married and he has a life of its own with her now. It would have been really painful to me if my father had never recovered from my mother's suicide and I value what they have, even when she's a bitch on occasions, has a bad temper, strong family values that I don't always agree with. But meh, we all have stuff to carry through life. For some it's bipolar, for others it's resting bitch face. Let's all grow up and try be a family.

I am so, so happy to see my father again in a week and hopefully, see him more and more in the upcoming months !

I'm not bipolar, but my girlfriend is. I'll try to put the information in bullet points so everything stays clear and organized. 

* She was diagnosed about a year ago, when she was in rehab for her addiction to cocaine.
* She's being treated since that moment and she's taking mood stabilizers. She accepts the treatment, because it has drastically improved her life. She has not done cocaine again or engaged in dangerous activities as she used to. She told me that she wouldn't like to go back to cocaine ever again.
* She really likes her psychiatrist.
*  She also sees a psychologist, that she absolutely dislikes because she feels judged and get the impression that this woman tells her how to live her life, instead of just giving her the tools to improve hers. She cannot change because her therapy is being paid by the Public Health Care.
* She's a college student, lives at home and is completely dependent on her mother. 
* One of the reasons why she is not financially independent is because her mother doesn't want her to get a job (her reasons are that she cannot trust her not to go and find drugs or because a job will give her money to go buy drugs).
* She isn't allowed to go out of the house for the same reasons. She needs to ask for explicit permission. So her routine is just going to college and back home. I think her mom doesn't understand that if she wanted to get cocaine, she would get it and this sort of abusive control makes everything worse. 
* She isn't allowed to have a cellphone anymore (she got drunk one night and her move took it away) and when she had one, her mom would read her convos, so she didn't use that much. 
* Obviously she cannot drink alcohol, but she drinks it every once in a while, sometimes with moderation and sometimes in excess. I cannot really judge her, because I did the same in my freshman and sophomore years. Anyway, her mom smells her breath sometimes to make sure she's not drinking. If she has, well... everything goes to hell. Her mom revokes the few privileges she has and she doubles her attention on her. 
* She smokes weed every once in a while. Sometimes just because she feels like it and other times when she feels under stress. 
* While she went on vacation with her family, her mom discovered she had smoked weed. And now she wants to send my GF to rehab or the rest of her winter break, so for a month or so. They both insulted each other and physically hurt each other. Honestly I don't know who starts, I guess my girlfriend when she smokes and her mom when calls her all sorts of names and then it escalates. This promptly sent her to a depressive episode. It also means we won't be able to communicate or see each other during that time. She told me she was thinking about suicide or running away. I calmed her down and told her that she should focus on her mental health and that she should continue taking her medicine and that we would deal with the rest later. She has always been really vocal about how much she hates being controlled by her mother.

I don't want to paint her mother as a monster, she had my GF when she was a teenager and their relationship seems like cats and dogs. They're co-dependent. Sometimes their relationship is fantastic they are really close and are sweet to each other and then boom! It explodes and they both start insulting each other and get violent. On the other hand her mom saw the worst of her when she hadn't been treated (we didn't know each other at the time) and how she was losing her life to cocaine. She was the one to be proactive about her mental health. She also enrolled her in college. My girlfriend loves studying and what she's learning at school. 

About us: 

* She's in her early twenties (on paper she's an adult, but her family treats her like she was 15), I'm in my late twenties. 
* We have been together for about 7 months.
* We have a lot of communication and she tells me everything and I do the same. Including the stuff her mom forbids her to do: when she goes out without permission, when she uses the internet without permission, when she drinks, when she smokes.
* She has never ever been anything but sweet to me. She listens to me and asks me for advice, that she follows through as well as she can. She has also been there for me when I was having a hard time. She's super encouraging as well and even if it seems the other way around, she's very stable and reliable. But her family never gives her the independence to prove it. Of course that is related to her past behavior when her life was a mess during her teen years. 
* I live abroad currently and I'm gonna change jobs in August, so I'll earn more than I earn right now. I would be able to sustain us financially. 
* I don't have the financial ability to do so right now.
*  I wouldn't mind if she were to move with me then. BUT I wouldn't like her to be dependent on her mom and then move abroad with me (she needs to complete her education and we would have to find more information about the visa process) and then be dependent on me. I want her to be her own adult and I'd love to help her to gain her independence, but I don't know how to do so. 

I'm completely lost guys, we both love each other and she tells me that love can conquer it all, but I know how bad she feels living with her mom and the HUGE impact it has on her mental health. We both like to come up with a plan to help her out of her situation. She told me she was thinking about suicide, but that she doesn't want to think it and she hates herself for it.",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94364,public,self,,,I would love your advice on how to help my BP girlfriend.

I worked a bit throughout this holiday but I literally lost my sanity a few times for a period of time, especially when I worked so I had to quit and I am struggling with some mental illness (probably some kind of bipolar), I am alone most of the time and see a friend once every week up to a month and a half at some point.
I basically dragged a friend to go out with me on my birthday and spent each holiday alone which is no help. 
The only good things in my life that made me happy were mma and weed but my parents won't pay for the gym (even though I went 5 times a week for a few months) because one time I bought another month but only went the first week because I became super depressed so now they won't pay for it.
They have the money, that's not the problem, they just think they know better then me and still treat me like the child I used to be a few years back, they won't get that image out of their head. They keep telling me to go out and do stuff but when I try to tell them I *need* the mma back since it was literally the only good thing I had in my life, they say they won't throw the money away and that I won't go, they always seem to worry with words but when I actually need something they are not there. 
The second thing that is good in my life is weed, it (usually) makes me laugh for a change or just be a bit happier. 
Right now I am fine, and at a state that I am sharp, can be charismatic, decisive, in control, but sometimes I literally lose my mind and have a break down. And I most likely had mania episodes throughout my life, but even that doesn't happen much since most of the time I just rot in my room, I have nothing to do even if I feel motivated to do something and I feel way too bad to go out running, maybe mania episode will kick in and I will get back to it but after not passing army tests for a roll I tried to get I just don't see any reason to anymore.

The good thing is I nowadays know exactly who I am, I don't take shit from anyone and know only to care about my friends, I used to know that's how I should be but deep down I always cared until like a month ago, after losing my mind, I realized and understood things better.

Like I said I am now in control of every situation and know how to handle everything even when super depressed, and I am very happy about it since I know what it's like losing a grip on reality and don't want to go through that again. 

I also have a fear I still don't have grip on reality or that I suddenly slip and get back to ground zero but I don't think it will happen again, I hope I am past this.",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94373,public,self,,,"My mental health is as bad as it can get, my parents won't help, lonely, maybe insane idk",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/en8w4l/my_mental_health_is_as_bad_as_it_can_get_my/,house_only,1

My biggest fear is starting this process, causing my dad to hate me, and then failing at obtaining power of attorney, failing to help him. That would be the worst because he would lose the family’s support (not that we’d stop supporting him, but he’s paranoid enough as is and this would surely convince him we have it out to get him) without showing him a way out of it. 

Has anyone here had to give up psychiatric power of attorney? Did you mend those relationships after treatment? At this point I’d rather my dad be alive and hate me than dead, but it’s hard. It’s not like he’s all there for us to have a good relationship right now anyway. I’m just worried.

Gamify this frugality if you must, go overboard scrimping.  You are definitely broke, and not in a position to be charitable or enterprising.  

Remember that everything your family does for you is based in love and a fear that grows out of love. Always tell them where you are, but take whatever space you need.  They might not know what is best for you, and you needn’t capitulate to demands.  

Write, but do not publish.  Record, but do not post.  

Eat, sleep.  Drink water. 

You do not drink or use drugs.  Don’t smoke cigarettes, not even sympathetically— in fact, your impulse to join in, to join crowds, to peer in on parties, should be cautiously reconsidered whenever it perks up. 

You are not a smarter version of the person authoring these guidelines— if you must, think of these as being sent back from a future you survived into. 

Do not contact old friends/teachers, especially not with new collaborative ideas. Especially not her. 

Listen more, talk less— listen more, interpret less. 

Music, not podcasts.  No TV.  The news isn’t for you. 

Sure, become an Instapoet. 

“The illuminati” is likely a network of small-time mercenaries in central Asia.  That last time you credulously texted “The Illuminati,” lit candles, purchased ornate textiles, tried to join, is nothing to sneeze at, psychosis-wise.  Do not send anyone abroad money. How they knew last time you were manic— i.e. ideally prepped to believe in your own lucrative chosenness— is indeed strange. The world is indeed strange, but conspiratorial speculation leave to cooler tempers.  

Conserve and subdue your bliss with breath, and keep it to yourself. It will alarm most everyone else.  Not everyone who isn’t alarmed should be welcomed into your life intimately.  You will attract strange birds.  

Acknowledge that if cheeky prophylactic instructions like these significantly curbed true psychosis, outcomes would be a lot rosier, and interventional treatment less commonly necessary.   However, a self-fulfilling and self-affirming prophecy is that this will help you. 

Accepting that you can’t slow down your thoughts slows down your thoughts

If meditation is uncomfortable, love the discomfort— if meditation is impossible, try walking meditation, try gentle chanting. Remember that you are essentially gentle and you are essentially humble.  Try out the shallow part of the ocean to ground and revivify, and to chasten hypersensuality. Remember that you don’t know anything, and that this has always been the case, and has always been okay. 

Do not be scared of people.  You’ve done nothing wrong.

After that we never talked to each other. Keep in mind that I didn't tell at my friend. But his roommate while there were there.

I have been med free since the beginning of July, when I found out we were expecting. It was planned. I was on a low dose of lamictal before I found out. 

Other than some depressed moods and irritability, I have actually been doing okay. I had to get a new psychiatrist during all this, because my old one left. The new one wanted to put me on Latuda at my first visit, but my Obgyn said not to unless I am having worse symptoms. I guess it's not just birth defects but the medicine affecting the baby at birth/causing unnecessary complications. 

I think what I have going for me, through all of this, is that my husband has been there for me through *past* episodes of psychosis. He knows when something isn't right. My goal has just been to keep the pregnancy and myself as healthy as possible. As many people with bipolar have understood, it is sometimes very hard to recognize when you are going ""off the edge"" by yourself. So having my husband helps a lot!

My next step is to come up with a ""postpartum plan"" for meds after delivery. I am meeting with my psychiatric NP this month so that we can have a plan. This was discussed at my last Obgyn appointment and honestly I can't wait to get back on meds after he's born (3/18 due). Not gonna say that I am severely depressed, but I am dealing with low moods. Also, I feel irritable for literally no reason and it is not fun...I don't get aggressive or angry outwardly. My irritability/anger inside however, feels ""out of control"" for the situation.

'Mania' Poem 1/11/20

I so desperately wish  
For bursts of energy  
Streams of those hues of life  
A glorious prism  
That seeps into me  
Deep into my soul  
I feel engorged.  
Can others taste the excess, that I do?  


I wish to touch, and feel alive. 

To be touched, and gift a day's moment, that  
feels like a lifetime.  
I wish to breathe heart into the mundane and the numb.  
To find that spark,  
That ever knowing flavor  
Of high -- to come to it again  
As naturally as  
The time before.  


Before it becomes tragic.  
Before the goop of confusion  
Sticks itself to  
My every path  
And wears me down  
Until only the raw core  
Of my essence remains.  
Before the shadows of fear, of checking every step that everyone else makes  
before they strangle me first.  


Of course,  
What can do they do  
That the suffocation, of this every day living  
Hasn't already scratched out of me?  


I don't want this extreme.  
But, it's the closest thing I have  
To feeling awakened  
(Though, never enlightened)  
That ever fleeting sensation  
Of meaning and purpose  
In the drought of war  
Of me, battling against  
Myself.

Depression Poem 1/11/20

&amp;#x200B;

Aches and pains beget my bones  
With no physicality behind them.  


Stops and starts abound my life  
With no signs of the cycle changing.  


Block by block, the numbness builds  
And bleak thoughts climb their way up high  
As they present the only energy that exists in my minds eye.  


Neighbors stare on, relatives comment  
My family knows not what to do.  
My friends don't engage.  
Isolation ensues.  


Sadness isn't the answer  
To this state of affairs  
For if it were, perhaps you could cry  
Of course, no tears bear  
Themselves to you.  
Your efforts burn.  
You'd scream, but what's the point?  


Fields of joy, can no longer populate  
Nothing pollinates your mind  
(For) nothing fresh, nothing hopeful grows.  
Instead, barren lays the channels  
That should spark  
Your connection to the world.

My thing is that I think my real personality has a fuckton of energy in general and I cannot envision myself as a 'flat person' by any means. I do not want to lose my energy. If I am to be medicated I would do so in order to get closer to a sense of authenticity within myself. Stability is important but not as important as feeling like I'm ME. Is there perhaps ways of medicating that might not keep you super stable, but at the very least take the edge off? For example you still have ups and downs but you're not suicidal or impulsive or delusional anymore? I think I'm in the early stages of a manic episode right now and all I can feel is that I really do want to feel like this all the time. Like I want this sensation to be my 'stable'.

How do I know I wasn't just having a bad day when I went to see a doctor? How do I know I'm not just experiencing normal moodiness or making it up in my head? Diagnosis is Bipolar II and I've never been manic. Doctor said I have been hypomanic but it just seems like I haven't. I never spend thousands of dollars on needless stuff. The most impulsive thing I've done is spend a couple of hundred. It didn't exactly break the bank as I have good income. I felt bad about it after and regretted it, though. My ""hypomania"" sometimes lasts a few days but sometimes lasts just one day. I've only had one major depressive episode this past summer which is when all of this began. Even when hypomanic, I don't stay awake for days on end. I usually just function off a little less sleep (4-5 hours instead of 8-9). My moods seem to almost shift daily now which is also a reason why I'm doubting the diagnosis. If I really had bipolar disorder, I would have clear major depressive episodes like the one I had this past summer and then clear hypomanic episodes that last a week or so, right?   


Yesterday, I woke up elated and ready to greet the new semester at work despite getting 4 hours of sleep. I had a few coffees, was outgoing and cheerful, super productive, etc. I came home and really wanted to go out and do stuff after work. My wife and I went out shopping and I spent $100 on clothes I didn't need. Again, I don't know if this is hypomania because I can afford $100 even though I wouldn't usually like to spend on clothes I don't need. But then my hypomania turned into irritation and I got snappy for no reason. I wasn't tired at midnight so I took a Zoplicone and slept a full 9 hours. What if yesterday's cheery and productive mood was just mind over matter?   


Today I feel ok. Not good but not hypomanic either. Maybe a little bit low? I'm not on anything right now other than an SSRI. I told my doctor I want to wait until the summer months (when I don't teach) to start messing around with medications.

How do you know when you love someone? I know what it feels like to love myself. I've been working on learning how to do that for two years now. However I feel like I don't know what it's like to love someone else. I've been on a lot of dates and was even in and out of a relationship this past year. But I didn't feel that spark.

I'm wondering is it simply because I didn't love any of them? Maybe it's my meds suppressing that passion for other people? Maybe I'm so focused on loving myself that I have no love for other people?

&amp;#x200B;

It was only a few days ago I posted this dramatic (but legit) difficult moment [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/eh1wp5/it_hit_me_suddenly/) I got some really helpful replies and I am so happy I reached out. Thank you for being here. 

 

TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was the day for my first Pdoc appointment since June. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a very difficult year last year. My last Pdoc wanted to lower my Lamictal dose by 100mg and it sent me into a manic episode. I stopped going to him and stopped my meds cold turkey. Reeeeeally smart on my part. Today I was back in front of a new doc as I have moved and it was wonderful.

&amp;#x200B;

I expected for it to be difficult. I had an intake appointment back on 12/21 and it was so hard. I have been rapid cycling and also having mixed states, really just a fucking mess everyday since June. Being in front of a medical professional again was overwhelming in my fragile state. I got through it and made it to my appointment today. I only got about 4 hours of sleep last night and I expected to feel like crap about my appointment, but I didn't. I was excited to maybe feel better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Appointment went really well. She was very kind and really dug into my past and current self. I explained that I had great mania management success on Lamictal 400mg and Abilify 30mg. I also took Lunesta 2mg for sleep. She had no problem ok-ing that part of my cocktail again. I opened up to her about how I have never been able to tackle my depression, OCD, and anxiety issues. She suggested Prozac at 20mg. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a bit leery honestly. I have had adverse reaction mania episodes with Paxil and Trazadone in the past before I was diagnosed Bipolar I. So not a positive sign for SSRIs. I told her this and she said she believed that there was a good chance of keeping the mania at bay with the Lamictal and Abilify together. She feels this is the prefect way to combat all the issues I am having with one medication and that 20mg is a relatively low dose as it can get as high as 80mg.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to try it out but I am wondering if anyone else has some experience with an SSRI while being on an anti-psychotic and mood stabilizer.

&amp;#x200B;

New cocktail:

&amp;#x200B;

Eszopiclone (Lunesta) 2mg. 

Aripiprazole (Abilify) titrate up to 30mg over the course of 8 days.

*Lamotrigine*  (Lamictal) titrate up to 400mg over several weeks, starting at 50mg.

Fluoxetine (Prozac) 20mg. 

I am also taking OTC meds multivitamin, fish oil, Zyrtec (allergy pill) and Spironolactone 100mg for PCOS.

&amp;#x200B;

Second question, is about weed. I brought it up to my Pdoc that it was very helpful for my anxiety and OCD but that it can make me wicked paranoid. I asked her what her thoughts on it were. I live in a illegal state so she was kind of giving me under the table advice, but she did say that she could give me a referral for an eval after we get my meds to their full dosages and if we didn't see any improvement. Is anyone still finding weed helpful after getting their cocktail right?

&amp;#x200B;

I am really hopeful. And excited. I can't wait to feel better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wellbutrin and risperdal. We started with the risperdal at 1mg/day, but after 3 months I had a hypomanic episode so we doubled it to 2mg/day. On 1mg I didnt notice any cognitive deficits. I didn't really have any problems. On 2mg my short term memory is practically nonexistant.

I have been complaining for 9 months that I cant remember anything. I'm in school so memory is very important for me. Also, basically the only thing I've ever prided myself on was my intelligence. Now I feel like an idiot. My boyfriend read me a poem and asked what I thought. I couldn't remember a single line, nor the main idea. Within seconds it was just gone. I often get frustrated and even cry over my memory.

The problem is that this med combo has been SO good. Ive been so stable. For a couple of reasons a lot of mood stabilizers arent a good option for me. So for treating mania, antipsychotics are really the way to go. 

My boyfriend, following the advice of the pinned post on r/bipolarSO's, has told me that if I ever stopped taking my medication he would be forced to break up with me. On occasions where I admitted I missed a pill he would drive me home and watch me take it. 

And now I haven't taken the risperdal in 6 days. The guilt is killing me. I cant look him in the face. But I cant keep feeling stupid all the time. I cant take it for one more day. Unfortunately I go to a free clinic for my psychiatrist so I only get to see her once ever 3 months...I wont see her again until mid february.

Honestly I dont know what the plan is right now. Hide this for another month? Certainly if I start noticing any manic signs I'll take it for a little bit. But what is my end game? Just a different antipsychotic? Will that really be any different?

So I used to shave about once a week for work. 

At some point while in therapy and looking back, I noticed that whenever I was having a depressive episode, I'd stop shaving altogether and get that unkempt look about myself. Sometimes for over a month.

It was definitely a symptom but it kind of made me wonder if controlling the symptom could help control the cause.

So 3 months ago I bought myself some really nice shaving equipment that purposefully takes time to use. The old stuff with lathing up soap using a brush, safety razors, that whole thing.

I set it up almost like a shrine in my bathroom and forced myself to shave.

Every single day. It took trice the time it used to due to the prep work.

Heat water, soften the brush, fill washing basin, lathe the brush, lathe the face, save carefully as not to cut myself, clean everything up, aftershave, face lotion.

I have to get up 10 minutes earlier than I used to.

And I won’t lie, often I HATE starting the process.

But I always love the moment right after.

I feel like I cared for myself. I feel like I look good.

My wife (who is very supportive) compliments me.

I start the day on a good fresh page.

And my average mood has improved somewhat.

I'm looking for some advice in trying to help my adult sister (23yrs) in California.  There is a lot going on so I'll try to keep it brief.

Present day we've seen her decline rapidly since thanksgiving. Behavior includes, intense crying, insomnia, picking fights with family/friends/strangers, drug use (alcohol &amp; marijuana), ""help"" fixation (where she tries intensely to help her friends, to the detriment of her own resources: money, gas, etc,.), and finally dangerous activity seeking.

She is a childhood survivor of rape when she was 14 years old, at the time I was in college doing my own thing, and all I heard from my family is that she was at a party, drinking way too much, and was found having sex outside the party.  She insisted that it was someone her age, and that it was consensual. So the police and my family dropped it. It was not. This thanksgiving she found out through word of mouth that the perpetrator was an adult; and that started a steep decline since then. She was also diagnosed during middle/high school as low learning, and thus was part of special education.

After high-school he has had periods of being able to hold a job, and help out at the house; but it has been going down hill for about two years.

Highlights:

* STD Diagnosis
* Instances of cheating on her partner
* Partner emotionally, and verbally abusing her
* Partner physically abusing her, and then the police was called on him and he was sent to jail
* Same-day highs and lows
* Suicidal ideation, with clear plans to do so
* Stranding herself because she runs out of gas, repeatedly (up to twice a week).
* Unable to hold a job, because of her anxiety
* Fighting with family ( other family members are not helpful, because they have an opinion and want her to understand it )
* Picking fights online social media, and ""local dating apps"" trying to hookup for money/help
* Driving recklessly

Anyway, each bullet point above is worth a few paragraphs; but like I said I'll keep it short.

Lastly before new years.  In the evening an event happened at the family home, and I was called to intervene. I'll skip the circumstances, but she felt very trapped and unable to escape. She happened to be drinking and smoking MJ in the house locked up in a room, and was trying to jump out the window trying to escape my mom. My mom &amp; brother stopped her, but she was in hysterics for a good 20-30 minutes until I got there.  After calming her down a bit, I brought her to the ER to apply an involuntary hold, since she felt suicidal.

They put her in a facility for about 36 hrs before releasing her to me. Then about 24 hours later we meet with a county therapist where she takes her case, and starts the process of connecting her with resources.  By this point she does not have access to her belongings. The family did not feel safe with her at home, so we tried to find her a local shelter. No beds available.

So she stays with me for another few days.  During this time, I talk to her and implore her to reconsider her actions and to reach out to the help we are providing her. One day while I'm working she is able to get a hold of her car again; and poof she disappears into her world again with her cell phone. Restarting the mayhem online, and with friends/family/strangers.

About two days later her car breaks down. She returns to mom, and I guess in a moment of weakness on my moms part; she lets her borrow her car so she can make it to her scheduled appointments. Restarting the mayhem again.  I called the county therapist today and she missed the appointments.

We called local cops about her not returning the car for two days, but because its moms car and she is a daughter they wont do anything about it.  Seemed like BS to me, and so did her county therapist.

At this point, without clear evidence of dangerous driving/drinking &amp; driving, we don't have much of an option to stop her.

I want her to get treatment and help, and maybe she is not bipolar, it could be other issues related to all of the trauma she has had. My family is no stranger to mental health issues; by brother is an alcoholic and recovering; and a sister with schizophrenia managed on medications.  But this is getting to be too much for us to handle.

I'm planning on calling the non-emergency line to give them all the information on her so we can try to get her off the road.

Reading on here I realized she may have been self medicating with marijuana, but that also has a dark edge too as I understand.  I read how in California that court required treatment may be possible; but it sounds like it would have to get pretty bad for that to happen (violence, court, etc,.).

I'm keeping in touch with her county therapist; but she says unless she wants help we cant force it on her.

And a little bit of my own \*sigh\* is that it is very common for her to use our family private texts to twist the narrative in her favor on online social media to rally her friends against us.  So far she hasnt figured out that her social media is fully public.

\- You need to be 100% accountable for your actions. e.g OPmind: wants to fuck rando. OP: SO, I wanna fuck XYZ but I want you to know that I know I won't do it if you know my shitty thoughts :)   
\- You need to also be 100% honest and self aware about your condition towards yourself and your immediate family (mine being my husband)  
\- If you are going to lose your shit, the only person who will get hurt is you.  
\- Make sure your spouse/partner is accountable for their own actions, ensure they are a voice a reason and give them the opportunity to be 100% open and honest about they feel.   
\- Before starting a fight with anyone, ask yourself: ""Did they actually do a shitty thing or is it a shitty thing to just you?""  
\- I can only deal with serious responsibilities when I am 100% neutral. Nothing else.  


These rules have helped me (with myself and my marriage) take a step back and helped me gain more of a perspective of my condition as well.

On the outside, I look like a cold, mean, rude person but this condition makes me wanna indulge in being the worst of the worst and I prefer to live in a world full of unwarranted honesty coming from my mouth rather than inflicting pain on others. My husband does get a touch upset that I am a bit more disconnected and rude overall but I have gained his respect as a person - something I lost when I attacked him the one and only time 5 years ago. It's also helped my husband take accountability for some of his own actions (that were ignorant and triggering me) and it has been the best thing ever.

I saw a preview before Star Wars today. [Here's the trailer.](https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2588719641/)

To summarize: woman meets this guy who's handsome and successful and think she's got the greatest guy ever and invites him on a trip to an island together. Only the guy forgets all of his psychiatric medication at home and proceeds to have a manic episode on the island. Oh and it's a comedy. And it's half in English and half in Spanish and his psychiatrist is Jason Alexander.

I don't know how I feel about the movie. On one hand I think it's good that the movie is about someone who may have a laundry list of disorders but with treatment and meds is highly functional and desirable as a partner. I think it's probably a sign of greater acceptance of people with mental illness and it's great that we're all talking about it more.

But on the other hand, watching the trailer, I have a hard time seeing how a guy having a manic episode is supposed to be hysterical. It's not just that it's of dubious realism. I have a pretty dark sense of humor sometimes but I'm undecided how I feel about it. Especially since I don't like the implication that people with bipolar disorder are missing one dose of meds away from a breakdown.

I was lonely and felt isolated and kept being reminded of people and their amazing lives filled with groups of friends and best friends to go out and do things with when I had no one (nearby as my old friends are 3 hours away). Which is the absolute worst thing when you aren't stable. I hated seeing my friends and other people having fun together and having people to be with.


I also had a guy (who has BP but 1 instead of 2) stalking me on instagram and made me feel terrible because he had helped me feel less lonely.


All of this just impacted me so much I just decided one day to not use either app anymore and it helped me immensely be able to focus on my own journey and life without thinking about others or feel jealous or sad.


I was able work on improving myself and moved somewhere better, got a job and am around an amazing group of new friends who I do things outside of work with. All I wanted. I now have purpose and love life and have never been happier and stable (except I might be a bit too happy and energetic at the moment haha). 


I'm thinking of downloading them again now that I am much better and am confident in myself and my life and feel great but I'll see.

I’m waiting for a diagnosis but I’m trying to monitor myself in a way I never did before.

I’m an extreme introvert so my behaviour while hyper may appear normal to you.

Symptoms I’ve noticed:

-	4 days ago I started not needing more than 4 hours sleep. I am too full of energy. I usually need 9 hours sleep at least. 
-	I am normally depressed. Suddenly, the world is full of options and I’m feeling optimistic. I’m making jokes and I never make jokes.
-	I’ve bought £400 of tech as I “deserve it”? And life is looking up so it’ll all be fine.
-	I’m in the middle of buying steroids so I can bulk up. I’ve never used steroids in my life.
-	I usually never think of sex. At the moment, I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m spending hours looking at porn every day. I usually would only spend an hour a week.
-	I’m more out going. Speaking to more people and making plans. I never do that. 


I really feel none of this is ‘me.’ It’s a shame as I like bits of this. I like the funny version of me.

•Possible Triggers
•Healthy Habits to Start
•Unhealthy Habits to Stop
•What to avoid in general
•How I can avoid getting to “up” or “down” (being vague here for a reason but I’m sure you can assume why)

I kind of need you know. I have been battling ADD and Bipolar. It's been worse the last year. I have been suffering from concentration issues when i work so i need to take larger dosages of Dexamphetamine than usual. I also have a shunt (dont know the english spelling) operated into me because i had hydrocephalus as a child. A side-effect of that is that react really weirdly on meds. 

I have been reacting bad and having side-effects on my Ergenyl so i started (with help from my doctor) trying different dosages and other meds as well. Which have made my hypomanic or depressive states been more extreme and more sustained than ever before. 

When i am hypomanic i do really bad economic decisions, and my anxiety fueled by my ADD do them worse. I have a degree in computer programming and have a good salary. But have completly ruined my credit-rating still.   
I can't focus on my new job because every second i am scared of losing it. And losing it means i will go bankrupt. 

My girlfriend had a good job in construction. But got a tennis elbow and probably something else, since she cant really carry heavy stuff and are constantly in big pain and can't barely take low-income jobs. 

I barely handled being burnt out 2014 and just as it felt my life is getting better i lost a huge amount of money thanks to fucking funds wheres most of my savings where. 

I am used to constantly being in states of depressions because my manic episodes actually make me feel happy before. i got energy to do stuff and i did not have to many bad side-effects. Until i started taking meds.  
And especially changing dosages. I have tried taking my life 2 times in 2014 when i got burnt out. And i did a massive overdose on anti-anxiety pills this last August. But now i am done. I don't even know if i really feel depressed or anxiety anymore. All of my body feels so fucking heavy. I have a constant pressure on my chest and it feels like my heart is trying to burst through my chest all the time. I am so tired of fighting. Everytime i overcome an obstacle 2 more arrive. The last years have come with much joy but also the last years gave me Diabetes, i got assaulted and beaten to a pulp once. I got Swatted (Isnt it was it's called when the police break through your doors with no apparent reason?). Basicly they thought i was selling marijuana, why you may ask? Because someone 3 doors next to my apartment did and the Police thought i looked weird and suspicious. Their own words. I had face-piercings and a huge beard. I also survived a car crash. Twice.   


Also my family has suffered through cancer.: Four times so far on different family members, MS, Alzheimers. I know it's wierd and selfish to think. But it feels like my bloodline is cursed sometimes. I have so many dreams, hopes, wishes that i hope to come through. But know i don't know how to handle tommorow. Today was a bad day. But i managed to get through it thanks to my body reacting and just made me sleep. Last night i slept from 20:00 (8pm) to 06:00. Just to fall asleep again at 08:00 and waking up at 16:00.  


I am meeting my doctor again on monday. It''s friday night now. But i seriously don't know if i will make it. I wont slit my wrists nor jump in front of a train. But i am so fucking scared i will come into a ultra-manic state, overdose on meds. Fall asleep and not waking up if my blood sugar is to low. Worth mentioning is that the last 6 months i cant feel my low state of blood sugar as before.

My cycles for years have been very limited and easily controlled. I've noticed over the last month, however, that there have been signs that I was swinging up - but I OWN bipolar. I don't swing up. I just have an altered appetite and don't sleep right, but I'm not *manic*. I'm not even *hypo*. I'm just bipolar with no symptoms but for physical stuff that doesn't matter (like eating and sleeping disturbance, I'll bounce back, nothing to worry about). 

But it's a lie I'm telling myself right now. I woke up at 5 AM - 4 hrs sleep, and that's with seroquel - and realized I haven't had a really good sleep in weeks. Every night I'm waking up every 60 min or sometimes not even sleeping but just in that in-between zone of awake and asleep. My appetite is barely under control - I'm sucking down calories like I was weight training. But the reality hit me earlier today. Went to the grocery store. While walking there, I felt just horrible, really sad, but at the same time, way invigorated and ""alight"" after 4 hrs sleep, if you know what I mean. And once in the store, I was wired and on fire while fighting back tears an ocean of tears. 

Standing around people in work suits, store employees stocking stuff, people on their lunch break, I had a swirling moment where I admitted, ""well fuck, I'm mixed. Fuck."" 

So, as part of not allowing myself to pretend this isn't the reality, I'm telling you all. I'm mixed. Sucks. Everything will be fine and I'll come through the other side clean and good.

It’s been roughly since I’m 9 that I’ve had repetitive mood balancing, but now that I have a really heavy schedule and a really rhythmic life, everything accelerated: I can get angry and irritable for the most insignificant thing while being sad and thinking about in which direction the white Audi in front of me will run me over to kill me, and a few hours/days/weeks after, I can be the happiest and most euphoric person in the world, being motivated to do what would otherwise would be hard for me normally.

I really feel like I don’t need to sleep that much (my nights are usually 2 hours-long but it’s enough for me to cover the next 2 days), there are times I can eat whatever my stomach can take (It’s happened to me to eat like 3 12in pizzas in one hour, along with some Iced Tea) but if I don’t eat I don’t feel the need to do so.

There are also times when I think about many many things without taking the time to process and develop each thought, as they pass as fast as they got to my brain.

Until this very afternoon I didn’t suspect bipolar disorder, although I felt for long enough that I was different that all the friends I got along with. One of my early psychologists suggested bipolar disorder but I didn’t believe it. How ironic...

I didn’t understand until now why I yelled at so much friends, why I nearly lost some, why I was sad as hell...I’ve already thought of getting in my mom’s Volvo and crash myself into whatever gets in my way, just to put an end to all of this. Now it all makes sense, but I don’t know how to announce it to my friends and family, not earlier than this afternoon a friend and I yelled at each other because of very futile stuff, and it’s not the first time we yell at each other.

Add to that the fact that I am bisexual and both my crushes asked each other out, it doesn’t seem I’ll find somebody that will like me or that I’ll like.

I did multiple tests this afternoon, and all got me to the conclusion that there is an almost 100% probability of bipolar disorder.

What should I do...? To get my friends as close as they were, to keep a stable life, I don’t know..

I have a mild form of psychosis/schizophrenia that has responded well to Abilify so far. I’m also unfortunately extremely sensitive to medication so I haven’t been able to tolerate other medications.

If you are on Abilify what dose are you on? How long have you been on it? What side effects do you have?  Has it helped your depression and if so, how?",True,False,[],False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,94310,public,self,,,Abilify experiences,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/emy0i9/abilify_experiences/,house_only,1

Get a hold, slip and miss.
No longer beaming on restless nights,
Filling with rage, starting fights.
Thrashing out on those I adore,
Self preservation can be such a chore. 
Hatred engulfing all that I fear.
Thoughts are racing, are they sincere?
Friends and family turning away,
I pushed and pushed, why would they stay?
The rage subsides and I’m alone in my head,
Wishing I had chased stability instead.
Tears start flowing beyond my control,
Thinking of the life my disorder stole.
