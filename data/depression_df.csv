It took me a long time to understand that because of this family constellation, I became extremely passive and needy to be liked and loved by ANYBODY (leading to lots of horrible horrible relationship choices). Another weakness of mine is that I always opt for the secure options in life even though they make me very unhappy. 

Today is my 33rd Birthday and I've been crying all day long :( 

I'm stuck in the past and can't reach any milestones in life like real professional success or a stable relationship. I have an extremely low self-esteem and literally disgust myself, which leads to drama, jealousy etc. 

In addition to that, I have massive financial issues, because of student loans for an education that I hated, and I also need to support my grandma who put all her money into raising me. My parents never paid a penny.

So to sort of set the scene I'm not diagnosed by a doctor with depression but I believe and my friends believe I've been suffering from depression or things related to it (anxiety, paranoia etc.) For about 4-5 years.

Anyway last year my life finally got 'back on track' as I started going to a college on a course studying animal management which I enjoyed. However after about 3 months on the course (after christmas break) I came back and lost all my motivation and couldn't get out of bed, I was able to get through on 80% attendance and get into a higher level degree this year. 

Sadly the same thing has happened again and after christmas I've lost all my motivation and just pretty much skive all my classes, do no work and overall just dont put any effort in. It should be noted that I live on campus so I dont get 'forced' to so work like I did as a child.

She's still in high school and I'm already in college. It all started in summer, her self esteem vanished, she spent all of her time sleeping and playing games, she wouldn't even want to see me. School year came and went very quick, she had no friends and even got into fights, she couldn't stand being there and had to deal with panic attacks almost daily. Fast forward till now and she's getting home education as well as upcoming hospital treatment. She's been under professional help and very heavy meds ever since it started. She is also taking schizofrenic meds because there's a high (genetic) chance of her developing it soon. During these six months a lot of stuff happened - We drove to a mental hospital a few cities over and the administrators moved her to the top of the queue. I'm very close to her family and spend as much time with them as possible. We are all giving our best to help her. I've emotionally matured so much. I always comfort her and make sure she doesn't feel alone, make her laugh, encourage her, remind her of the good in her life and generally provide as much support as I can. Seeing the person you love suffer like this wears you out like a motherfucker but I always made sure she doesn't feel like a burden. She caught me crying a few times but overall we have a lot of achievements, pushed her self esteem forward, done a lot of brave things and had tons of good time in spite of what's happening. However since december things went a little south. I spent a month in bed due to a sickness which left me in a terrible place. We took a break so that I can get my shit together and I started feeling good again. The problem is - after we started hanging out again things just aren't the same anymore. We always encouraged open communication and trust each other a lot. She started being very controlling. Calling everyone I was with when I went out with friends. Stalking social media pages of the girl I helped with moving furniture. She even gets jelous and spams me when I'm with my cousins. I know it's toxic but she's in a very bad place. And that's the point. She's having gigantic mood swings, doesn't want to leave the house and anything I say or do can set her off and get angry with me. This is so painful since we were so purely happy with at one point. I don't want to end the relationship but I feel like at this point I'm only causing her trouble and making her state worse. Not to mention how it drags me into a bad place as well. I love her uncodnitionally, know when she's herself and when her sickness is taking over. She is the strongest, bravest, caring and most kind-hearted person I know. Has anyone been in such situation before and can give me some advice? No matter on which end.

I'm scared of people, sometimes I think they are laughing at me. I'm afraid of standing up for myself or people judging me for being gay and I don't feel comfortable with my appearance, especially in public.

I want to find my place, even if that means that the goals I have may not be for me.

Psychiatric treatment and meds have done nothing for me in my opinion, that's why this the first time I'll try with all my will to make this work because I think I can achieve all I want to do and this illness has been in my way for too long.

It has affected me at a point where I don't enjoy or do things I used to do anymore. My hygiene is not the same, I don't enjoy time with the friends/family, I don't want to meet anyone and I drink severely every weekend.

This is just to mark my progress from 2-3 years ago, when I came out about my mental health problems and to tell my story of how I got help so that maybe people in the same situation don't make the same mistakes I did.

TL;DR I was secretly depressed for a long time but now I am publicly less depressed and very proud of my progress.

I will be using UK terminology for school years and such. So to help here's the age ranges:

Primary school is for ages 4-11. High school is ages 11-16. Leaving high school you go to college then university.

First just some quick background info. In primary school I excelled at maths so I was praised for my natural talent for maths from an early age and easily coasted through primary school. While it's usually a good thing to be talented at maths like I was. However, I got lazy and never got tried to get better. This led to me doing awful early on in high school and ultimately snowballing into failing just under half of my classes by the end of high school alongside gaining depression and anxiety.

So all through high school I knew I was depressed, I'd talk to a couple of friends about it but other than that nobody knew. I hated life, myself, everyone and everything. For the record I am 19 current day so this would be 3-8 years ago. All throughout high school I hated it and never tried. First year I made a good group of friends that through the rest of high school really helped me to not descend into depression even further and even faster than I did. If it weren't for these people I 100% would not be here today. They made daily life bearable. However, despite this I still felt depressed and suicidal almost every day due to a rough relationship with my parents and teachers at school. I would never do homework or revise for tests s high school became a prison I would spend most of the day in not doing anything just to return home to lie to my parents about not having work to do just to play games. 

After high school I went to college to study Electrical Engineering for 2 years. Again I hadn't learnt to do any work in my free time. So my college work fell swiftly behind so I started to panic daily and stress over work being due in that I hadn't started. I hadn't really made any friends in the class. I didn't like the group apart from a few people that I would occasionally talk to in class. Other than that I would just go to class and do nothing or just skip class. 

About 3/4 through the first year I went to sleep crying. I just wanted to die. I hated myself and I would have done anything to not wake up in the morning. I did anyway and I got up without my glasses on which I never do because I get headaches without them. My mum noticed this and asked me about it. This led to me opening up to my parents about my mental health. My mum took the day off and took me to the doctors and got me to start tablets.  I finally started to get help.

I basically dropped out of college a week later as I was unfit to go to college. I continued to get help but nothing really seemed to work. However, I kept getting better due to the medication. I never really noticed this but my parents noticed a significant difference. 

Later that year I got back into college, this time in a 2 year IT course.  At this point I was still badly depressed and suicidal but i had got a little better. Sadly I still hadn't learnt to try hard in school so my first year went poorly. I ended that year with the lowest grade possible. However, I made some good friends that year. I had clearly got more sociable since the year before. Despite doing bad, I carried on into the second year.

Finally here we are. Current day. I am finally working hard in college and doing well mentally. For example, I noticed today that instead of walking with my head hanging constantly I am now walking with my head held high. 

So I've gone from a shy, depressed, unmotivated kid that was too lazy to do homework. To a fairly confident, not as depressed, hard working young man. I still have a long way to go but I have made a really good comeback. I read daily, go for a coffee with a friend in college when we have breaks and get my work done on time. If I hadn't got any help when I did,I surely would've killed myself within a couple weeks.

Thanks for reading such a long post and if you find yourself in the same situation I was in 3+ years ago, please just tell a close family member or loved one. Any help is better than no help. There is no instant fix as in my case it's been 3 years in the making and I am just now holding my head up high as I walk.

So yesterday I bought alot of percocets and went to work. During that shift I was the happiest I’ve been since I was a little kid. 

Just knowing that it would all be over soon brought me joy. I was actually able to eat a meal and never had to stop myself from crying once. I got home waited for my mom to go to sleep and then I sat at my desk with the pills in my pocket. 

I took the pills out of my pocket, and all of the sudden I thought about how it would crush my mom to find me the next morning dead. 

I started to think about how she’s always been there for me no matter how many times I’ve fucked up in life. I thought about how she used to pick me and my best friend up from baseball practice and take us to Dairy Queen for ice cream. I thought about how she always worked around the clock every December to get me the toys I wanted for Christmas. 

I started to get this overwhelming sadness that if I did this, it would put her in the same situation mentally I’m in right now, maybe even worse. I cant do that to her. She’s the only person that I’ve ever felt loved by.

From that moment everything went downhill. Got fired from jobs several times. In 2017 I stayed in a mental hospital after a maniac episode. The years after that I feel major depressed. Don't have any motivation to do something about it. I feel like a lazy and worthless person. Lately I think a lot about suicide, I can't find a good way to do it, tho. 

Easy and normal every day tasks seems impossible. Like eating right, doing grocery shopping. Two times a week I eat with my parents. The other nights I just eat pizza or something very easy. I cant find the right mindset to cook something more complex. Everyday and week I want to start better. Go to the gym but after I went I think whats the point of doing it?

Sometimes I distract my mind in dating. I go on dates with several girls at the same time just to feel accepted and loved. I know that it will end after 3 or 4 meetings because I have noting to offer. I just put up a fake mask and pretend i have a good life. So when it becomes serious I quit.

Every night I say to myself to go sleep early and wake early. But every night it ends in staying up very late. Sometimes till the next morning. Then I go to sleep and wake up at 14-15pm. Then most of the time I go to my parents to distract myself. When its getting dark outside I go lay down on bed playing on my phone or watch pointless videos on youtube. I cant commit myself to play a game or watch a serie. I only choose the easy and fast to consume ones.

So, in the last 6 years I have had many short during jobs, many dates with girls but never commiting to something. Getting out of bed every day is a struggle. Even if I would get a job it would be a hurdle to get out of bed, make my lunch and do all the other household chores after work. It seems I find it impossible to live a normal life just like everyone else does. 

My mind goes on and on the whole day from the moment I wake up. Thinking about everything that has to improve. Irritating about everything that goes wrong. Contemplating every desicion I have made. Its so exhausting to overthink everything like that. 

Friends are at a low level. Luckely I have a couple of close friends. But when we meet the conversations are starting to get shorter. Before everything I could talk a lot and talk with passion about stuff. I miss real connections with people. Itś like communication is more like a chore then something that comes naturally. 

About a month ago I quit taking medicines. I was on lithium and valproaat for my bipolar disorder. But i found out it made me more numb and emotional ignorant. I think I am better of without medication at the moment because medication is fucking you up at some point where you totally dont feel yourself anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no will to do anything, energy is non existent and happiness is long gone. For how I got to this point I have to go back 5 years ago when I discovered I have an eye disease called keratoconus where your cornea thins out and your vision is non existent to the point where you can't recognize your family members. Did two surgeries in hopes to slow down the progression, but even though it slowed down my vision is very bad. 60% in left and 50% in my right eye. 

&amp;#x200B;

Biggest problem is that every family member treats it as far sight or whatever they think. But at age 15 when it was discovered (and that is when I had my first procedure) it changed me and to this day it isn't any better. I wanna say that I got myself up above it, not completely out, for maybe a year. And then the second eye procedure was due 2 months ago. And since then  I have no will for anything, everything is blurry, everything I enjoyed from gaming to driving cars is taken away from me, can't enjoy anything. 

One friend knows the extent of my emotional state and that is it. For fucks sake I can't read text in front of me sometimes. 

Thinking of dropping out of university because I don't have any interest in anything, can't tell that to my parents yet. I'm almost 20 years old and I don't know what to do. I'm lost in the darkness. I spend most of my days inside my dark room and rarely go out. I am sensitive to sunlight because of my condition and I get reminded how bad my state really is when I go outside. My room is my safe place.

I lost my jobs some are really good jobs, I failed my relationship, cutting people away from my life, lost my possession, lost my way, relocated my self to different places but everything is still a mess. I want to have a normal life, being productive, being useful to my self and to other, and help people. But I have to help my self first. 

I just signup to psychiatrist today after long consideration. I want to repair the mess and rebuild my life again and I don't want the hurricane pays a visit again.

Sincerely,

I feel like each turn of the new year brings more bad luck than the year before and I'm just exhausted. I can even pinpoint the exact moment I brought this shit storm of a dark cloud into my life, which makes things worse; I spend every night thinking about how badly I want to go back in time and change my choices.

5 years ago I left my really great job as an Executive Assistant with a company I loved in Los Angeles. I left because the traffic was taking over my life. So, my boyfriend came with, and we moved to the Central Coast of California. I took a job as an Administrative Assistant III with the County; a job that was going to offer me more pay than my job in LA and great benefits... this was supposed to be a move in the ""right direction"". Well...

I was placed in a unit that was responsible for delivering office supplies and files to outer offices. I felt like my talents weren't even used in this role, which made me depressed. I was also being harassed by my supervisor &amp; a co-worker almost daily, making me miserable. So 1.5 years after dealing with that, I was finally able to transfer to a new unit within the County, something I hoped would ACTUALLY be the step in the ""right direction"". But no...

This new unit gave me a great supervisor and amazing new co-workers that were so warm and welcoming, but the nature of the work was extremely depressing and hard to handle. This was the Emergency Response Unit for Child Welfare Services. This is when I was officially diagnosed with depression &amp; anxiety. Spending 10 hours a day working on child abuse reports really takes a toll on a person. So last May, I was given a job opportunity in the Las Vegas Valley. A shiny happy new job in a creative field. Same pay as my County job in California, but someplace more affordable to live. And a job that wouldn't be surrounded with dark and negative aspects. Sounded like the opportunity of my dreams and the actual step in the ""right direction""... NOPE!

I started my new job in June last year. Upon starting my job, they had changed my job duties on me and expected me to know all these programs I had never even heard of before, yet refused to train me on them. Then, I was being horribly harassed by everyone in the office. People would say awful things to my face and behind my back, all because I didn't know how to use the programs they expected me to know with these new job duties that were never described before I accepted the job. I went to HR several times and she just told me to ""grow thick skin"". The harassment just got worse and worse, to the point where I'd hole up in the bathroom for hours a day, in tears, afraid of going back out to my desk. I had hit a new low in depression. My husband and my family noticed a big change in my well-being, and they supported my decision in quitting this job we had moved out of state for. 

Now, I'm coming up to month 8 of being unemployed. Something I've never experienced. In my 10 years of working, I've never gone more than a month without a career opportunity. I've applied to hundreds of jobs, only to get nothing. I don't have health insurance, so no more psychiatric care for my anxiety &amp; depression, which is only increasing by the minute. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired. I'm exhausted. I'm done being me. And I so wish I could go back in time 5 years ago and just stay in LA. Dealing with 4 hour commutes each day was better than anything I've had to endure since leaving...

He then told me he would explain why we have to break up and that he’s extremely stressed and depressed and having financial issues (and I know that for a fact) He doesn’t know where he’s going to liv after graduation if he doesn’t get a job.

He still refused to speak to me on the phone because he said he wanted to explain things “logically and not emotionally” and he said he’d explain the next day because he had to “think” 

Th next day he explained why and then he said that if he heard my voice or saw me that he would probably want to get back together but he can’t do that right now, so he’d rather just text me and will not talk to me on the phone.

He said that when he’s stable he’ll reach out to me and that he wants to be with me, but for right now I need to move on. He said to date other men if I meet someone and he said at some point when he’s stable he’ll reach out. He said “baby, goodbye for now”

I guess having it hard teaches you things like empathy, I just find there are some people that are so spoilt, I don't really desire to be there friend because they just lack something very fundamental, usually these people are popular and just fly through their careers rising to the top so fast, employers love them - but there's something not right about being like that.

I don't understand those people who don't understand depression, they think you can just get over it, I don't understand how someone just doesn't have any problems, but I find to think that you must have a bad personality, to me it just seems these people who couldn't empathize with depressed people is exactly what I find undesirable, maybe they are completely fake or maybe they just don't have problems. I just find when I look at people who are completely happy, there personalities are distasteful.

The thing is having depression could be seen as a gift in a way because it defines you, I find the qualities I have are probably only because i've had it pretty hard, growing up you just learn to accept things are hard, you become more resistant to it, I've somewhat come to enjoy the pain, it's made me tougher.

A few months ago (November) I failed my calculus 2 final, (covering laplace, vector calculus, and complex calculus) and just feeling hopeless (my university requires students to pass the final to pass the course). My 2.53 on a scale of 4 GPA (4.429 on a scale of 7) after 3 semesters of study means I will never get to grad school. I am Australian so grad school is an nonnegotiable necessity for me to work in the industry I want to which happens to be space systems as I need an EB-2 visa (which requires a postgraduate degree) to get into the US as a US person.

Now my life has no meaning whatsoever and I'm just sitting here listening to some depressing music.

To make things worse, I was once considered pretty bright in elementary and high school, having graduated 91.45 percentile from high school (called an ATAR here). I worked all my life to try to reach this goal but now it's just gone to shit in two hours. Guessing I really did fail the 10 year challenge.

I feel that, by committing suicide, I will be able to realise my life goals of working in the space industry as I strongly believe that a suicide is the only way to advocate for space funding in Australia. This is as the Australian government is against science to such an extent that they deny global warming even in the midst of the recent bushfires. By killing myself and leaving a mark on my family, I will force them to advocate for science on my behalf, and from the tears of my family, a beautiful thing will grow. 

TL;DR: All my entire life's work and dreams gone in a matter of two hours.",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,593431,public,confidence,self,I feel like suicide is the answer to achieving my life goals,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/et3aio/i_feel_like_suicide_is_the_answer_to_achieving_my/,no_ads,0.0

That basically describes what I went through in 2017. I've forgiven them but what they did changed me to the core. I lost all my close friends and any attempt at making new ones since then has left me with this horrible feeling of spite and anger. All I have left in my life is my dog, and I cherish him each and every day.  


When I try to be happy -- that is, when I try to be around other people for the sake of making friends, I can't bear the feeling of it. People I meet online, I keep at arm's length. People I meet in person while at school (I'm a Nursing student), I never allow them a chance to get close to me. If anyone does grow close, I simply stop talking to them -- a cold shoulder, ignored texts, ignored calls. If they keep pushing, I just end up blocking them.  


So why am I writing this? It's my conscious choice to make the decisions I make -- to block people out the way I do. It's my decision to be miserable and disallow anyone from both becoming part of my life, and me becoming a part of theirs.   


The problem is, I don't know why I do it .. every single time I start to feel happy around someone .. comfortable, secure, at peace, like I can be myself .. I just run away. I've lost count of how many amazing people I've simply told to screw off because of this. I used to be so social, so happy and carefree, I took pain in stride and smiled even when it hurt -- because I wanted others to smile too and not worry about me.   


And now .. what's wrong with me? All of this started after 2017. I decided to go into a relationship I knew was shaky from the start -- they'd hurt me in the past even just as friends, but I loved them enough to look past that and want to help them change for the better -- to start school, to push towards a good future for themselves, to break out of their anxiety. All I received in the end wasn't just nothing -- it was a negative value, I lost a lot. All my friends, parts of my personality, parts of my heart, my soul, my time, my patience.  


I love other people .. I love seeing babies cry, I love seeing people smile, I love seeing old couples at the park -- so what the hell is wrong with me? Why can't I let anyone get close?  


I don't know if it's a matter of no longer being able to trust anyone, or if I'm just scared. Every time I cut someone out of my life, it hurts me so much. I can feel my heart break just a little bit more at that lost opportunity, and on the rare occasion I actually begin to develop feelings for someone, the only thing I can think about doing is running even faster away from them than normal.  


I don't know if I'm depressed.. I hate myself, I push myself so hard in school for no good reason, I don't eat, I don't sleep, I over-exercise and not even because I have body-image issues -- I just .. hate myself. I really do. I can't work hard enough in school to feel any sense of self worth. I can't give enough back to my sister for all the years she helped me as a child. I can't hold enough doors for strangers, do enough good deeds, make enough people smile or laugh -- to stop hating myself.  


A part of me believes that others are better off without me in their life. Another part of me believes that other people only cause trouble for me. And yet another part simply believes that people are only heartbreaks waiting to happen -- disappointment and pain in the form of a ticking time bomb.   


It's been like this for three years now. Three long, grueling years. I'm sure my dog is sick of hearing about my school days and how I did on tests.

I was due to kill myself this Sunday after a weekend with my kids and have just realised, for the first time ever, I don't want to die if there's another option. I'm now looking at how I can sort things to stay alive.

The point of my post is that no matter how bad things are you may want to live later on in life, even if it's near 20 years later like it is for me. If you can battle through you might be happy one day, if you die, that's it, never happy again.

I don't want to be preachy, just giving my experience, I may crash again in the next few days but I think it's important to post positives here as well rather than all masturbating over our common desire to die.

I never know what to say. I want to kill myself. I'm 14. I'm in 8th grade and I have shit grades. Fs and Ds for every grade except two. My mother is upset over my grades. I don't care about my grades. I don't care about my assignments. My mother tells me if I just do it then it'll get better. I can't ""just do it."" I can't tell her I'm depressed either, or that I want to kill myself. I probably would if she asked. She doesn't.   
Recently I've been getting a lot of intrusive thoughts. They're pretty much all murder. Coming up behind someone in the hall and stabbing them. I don't carry a knife on me. I know I'd never do something like that, but I also knew I'd never cut myself; the cutting was only a one-and-done deal and I forgot about it but it's not nearly as easy to ""forget"" about assaulting someone.  
I want to kill myself. But I don't want my mother to be upset. I know I won't care whether she's upset or not if I kill myself, I'll be dead. I feel like a pussy for not ending it and I feel like a bitch for wanting to do that to my mother. My father hasn't killed himself because children whose parents have killed themselves are more likely to commit suicide as well. I don't want to kill myself, because then what's keeping my father from killing himself? And then my mom will be left alone.

I am new to Reddit. I see my boyfriend use it often, so I figured I'd give it a try to find a sense of community and potentially find some help...
Quick background about myself: I am a 20 year old female... full time college student in STEM. I am on the pre-med track and hope to one day become a physician. I would consider myself to be a bubbly and sweet person on the outside, but I've struggled mentally for nearly my entire life. I went through some pretty rough trauma throughout my childhood as a result of verbal/physical/mental abuse from my mother and losing my father to cancer at 16. I always felt like it was a ""normal"" way to live and built up a lot of stress and anxiety. I grasped control over school/grades because it was the only sense of ""stability"" I could find in my life, and after moving away to college, my depression/anxiety started to catch up with my physical and mental health. I have been in and out of doctor's offices/hospitals for panic attacks/tachycardia, digestive issues (polyps and potentially ulcers), chronic headaches, etc.)
Update to now: Over the summer, I was going to the emergency rooms often for extremely high heart rates/blood pressure as a result of panic attacks. My depression and anxiety reached an all time high, and I decided it was time to get help. I have been in counselling for close to 6 months now, and I have been prescribed 40 mg of CeleXa and 30 mg of Vyvanse (in hopes of curbing mild/moderate BED as a result of depression)... I spent a lot of time in survival mode and eventually worked myself up to attend yoga every day, eat out slightly less, spend less time in bed, and attempt to get things accomplished. For the past few weeks, I feel like everything is just going in reverse. I often find myself in bed... I often find myself with insane cravings for random foods to fix my sadness... I want to cry and can't find the energy to do anything. I know it's a cycle and recovery isn't just a straight upwards trend... but it feels so disheartening when I am finally feeling better and then things crash and burn again. I was starting to lose weight and feel more confident... spend more time studying... eating better... etc. I know that I can't go from nothing to everything without burning myself out, but I also don't know why I can't just feel better. Does anyone have any suggestions or tactics?

I've basically realized she is not the person I fell in love with, and I like very few things about her now.

We had a pretty big blow out over nothing today which resulted in her having one of her famous panic attacks and I immediately dissociated. I found myself not caring at all that she was panicking, and the first thought that popped into my head was, ""this would all be so much better if I just dropped dead.""

I am just so tired of existing. Life is pointless. I've been in this relationship for so long that I wouldn't even know where to start if I were to leave her, so that idea gets immediately shot down. Not that I could afford a divorce even if I did go through with it. At this point I don't even have my own car because the one that is in my name, that i came into the relationship with, is a piece of shit, and I definitely couldn't afford a new one.

I don't really know how to start this to be honest. My life is a mess. I put up everyday with depression, it takes over my body for the majority of the day. Happy on the outside, broken on the inside. That's what people see everyday. Just screaming in my head for someone to save me from this. I truly don't know what to do anymore with my life. Suicide is my thoughts everyday.... I have friends that just make fun of me for everything. Used to have a lot of friends at school, they all just left. One day, just.... didn't want to have anything to do with me. Two of my friends who are girls got into a fight, I was best friends with one of them for so long...... The other girl hates me now because I stayed friends with her when it had nothing to do with me. They both don't speak to me anymore. I don't know what happened with my best-friend but she didn't want to talk to me anymore I guess. I'm a 15 year old male, about to turn 16. And just.... Life hurts.... Life hurts a lot for me. I can't take all of this shit anymore. I hate my year level, that's why I hangout with people younger than me now and I just get called a pedo... Even when they're one year younger than me. Highly considering taking my own life. My school life is a disaster, my home life is a disaster and I've just lost so many friends over the last 2 years. I must be a shitty person or something, I can't figure out how I lost 6 friends so quickly. I truly can't think of what I've done. I go to school everyday, just wishing for a bus or something to hit me on the way. Something to take the pain away. Writing this, I guess makes me feel a little better about everything. Also had a family member pass away in the last couple of weeks. Family was fighting last week and my parents kicked my older brother out. Called my older sister crying, not sure what to do. It's been over a year now since I nearly tried to take my own life, part of me wishes I went through with it, part of me also wonders who truly cares as well. I know I'm mentally ill, I just.... I don't know how to talk about it with family. I used to lie a lot when I was younger, my parents always think I'm lying now or seeking attention, when I'm just really broken inside. My family thinks i over exaggerate everything and that is why I'm scared to talk to them about things as well. My mind has been off in another world in the last couple of weeks. Been distancing myself from everyone, only talking to those who truly care about me which isn't often. I live a pretty good life. Parents do very well for themselves, been able to go on so many holidays and live better than most do. Yet, I'm not happy. Never been that happy with myself and anything I've done. I don't have any achievements that I'm super proud of myself. I guess the only real achievement I have has been able to earn $1,000 in my very first month of work.

During episodes I often use weed as a coping mechanism and a way to get everything off of my mind as I don’t like drinking or taking other drugs.

I’ve kept it a secret from my parents and just failed a drug test so I had to listen while my dad screamed at  me on the way home about how he has lost all trust in me and told me that I’m basically a failure, a disappointment, how my grades are below average, I never put any effort into anything and apparently I’m a pothead who doesn’t give a shit about anything except smoking weed. (Not the case.)

To top it all off at school today I was talking to some old friends of mine who are girls and it felt really good because I don’t ever really talk to girls that much and struggle with the anxiety that comes from it. They were winking at me, flirting with me all class, resting their hands on my thigh and I was just starting to have a good day because of it. One of them also just went through a bad breakup a little while ago and they were telling me how she really needs another boyfriend, so I got excited and figured that I may have a chance. 

After class they followed me to my advisory(basically a study hall class) and when I walked in another girl walked up to me and dramatically put her hand on her face and screamed “Oh hi IMAAssblaster!” then more girls started doing it and I finally started to get really confused. Then they all started laughing and said “It’s just a joke chill out” and I stormed out of the classroom and went to the bathroom to comfort myself. 

The part that really fucks with me is that I never talk to girls much and I never did anything to them to make them do that to me, and after the drug test fiasco I figured maybe something was finally going right but when I got home the first thing I did was jump in my bed and cry into my pillow. It’s the shittiest feeling ever when you’ve done no wrong to someone and they gather people to gang up on you and humiliate you when you’re basically defenseless and have no clue what is going. 

All this does is further reassure me that my luck with girls is never going to get better, along with my parents hating me for something that I do to help keep myself alive. I thought about opening up my door and jumping out of my car driving home today. I understand that I fucked up on one part but where did I ever deserve to be led on and treated like a piece of gum on the sidewalk?

My wife and I of 10 years have a 7 year old (soon to be 8) son. He is our only child, and we both love and adore him. At this point in his life I have expected him to take on responsibility, adapt to routines, and understand boundaries. Unfortunately he does not.  My wife, who experienced abandonment by her father smothers him emotionally and I fear is stunting his growth (she dresses him, coddles him, he still sleeps in our bed every night even though I have again and again voiced my concerns with him sleeping in our bed for the past 5 years, I have even directly told him that he needs to get out). 

The kicker to all of this is that I recognize this toxic behavior and anytime I attempt to instill discipline independence or bring it up I am made out to be an aggressor, which makes her the hero and of course him the victim. This has caused innumerable problems in our relationship (both my relation to my wife and son) yet my complaint falls on deaf ears. I am immediately ostracized, gas lighted, and manipulated to feel as if I am mentally ill and that I am trying to dominate them. I have a history of chemical dependency (marijuana) which I am in recovery for and it is immediately brought up (in front of my soon to be 8 year old) to humiliate me into backing down. I struggle with PTSD from combat and anytime I am frustrated I am told that I am not able to control my emotions (which is false, I am intentional with my interactions, especially around this area, and am accountable for my actions to a fault ) I am completely lost and hopeless in how to proceed. 

I don't want to be a passive father and watch my wife castrate my son, but the more I try and fix the situation the worst it gets. This has caused quite a bit of anger, anxiety, depression, isolation, and futility in my life and I am now at a point where I recognize it for what it is. Just writing this out makes it so surreal because this is such a major issue that I have no control of in my life. I come from an absolutely tragic family of origin so family and the drive to become a good father is very valuable to me. I have been fighting this fight for years to absolutely no avail. I have even tried to become ""perfect"" (although I am far from it) so that she can no longer deny that she is perpetuating this.

Depression: I suffer from depression generally but especially seasonally. again my wife uses this to point out that I am irrational. I know I suffer from mental illness (depression, PTSD) but I have worked on myself a lot in the past few years while my wife is in denial of her own issues. I love my family, but I am always the one left out. I am not trying to throw a pity party but rather articulate something that I believe is affecting my day to day experience.

During everything, though, I felt fine and was handling things well. For months I had been complaining of severe neck pain and long episodes of brain fog that I blamed on being too much nicotine from the new Juul I was using from quitting smoking months prior. I reduced the nicotine percentage and was slightly better. The Friday of that hell week though, unbeknownst to me would be the turning point I never knew was coming. 
Thursday, November 7th, I laid down in bed and started the hour-long process of going to bed for me, as it usually takes me that long, or longer, to fall asleep. Normal thoughts of the day raced through my head light a tornado like they always do. But, my brain somehow picked out this random thought and decided to focus on it. “What would it feel like to die?” more specifically, “Hey, think about the nothing-ness that IS death afterwards”. Now I am actually religious, so this didn’t compute with me. I felt a little guilty that I actually wondered what it would be like if there was just nothing-ness after I died. Like……eternal nothing-ness. I thought to myself “will I ever be conscious again?” or things like “what else is there after we die”. All of these thoughts I have thought of before and simply breezed by them and have never once stuck to them this long. However, something grabbed a hold of me that night and didn’t let go for a while. As I lay there, I could feel the physical sensations of fear streaking throughout my body. It was almost hot and cold sensations at the same time. They were in my chest and my arms and flowed through my legs…….then it stopped. I was able to brush everything off and finally fall asleep. Then….. the next day started my journey with the worst depressive episode I’ve ever been through in my life.
Friday, November 8th, 2019, I woke up in time for school as I normally do at 6:00am, got shower and got dressed and headed out the door. I noticed I felt more tired and foggy head than normal and thought it was just because I was tired. I powered through and got to school. But something was still off. I was….. more inside myself. I felt so….. disconnected from everyone. My friends weren’t my friends. The people I sat with at my table at school felt more like objects. I was really taken back by this feeling and felt a general since of discomfort the whole day. As I am an avid nap taker, I thought I might as well and leave school a little early and go home to rest and nap these feelings away. Figuring I would wake up refreshed and feeling much better, I let myself sleep as long as I wanted to since it was Friday and I had no obligations that pressing weighing down on me yet. As I awoke from the nap, I immediately had a heavier and quicker breath. I was so confused as to why this was happening. Then the thoughts of death came back. Was I having an existential crisis? Then I felt the fear. Pure, raw, and screeching fear associated with the nothing-ness that was death. I could feel the cold and hot sensations again. And this time, it came with the intense tremors. I started to feel like I was going crazy. Like, “Hey, I guess pharmacy school has finally broke me. Here we go.” I got extremely nauseous and started to dry heave until I eventually threw up what little was in my system. Then, for a little while it calmed down enough to somewhat function. My fiancée had gotten home and was wondering why I was home so early. I told him that I wasn’t feeling great and came home early. I told him I was feeling sad, but nothing else. He tried to generally cheer me up but nothing helped. Which worried me even more. Why was I not feeling happy? Actually if I think about it, I cant feel happy at all! I don’t want to do anything but lay on the couch. This weekend I needed to study for a major exam and I wanted to vomit at the thought of sitting down and studying. I physically shook when trying to pull out my laptop and study. I was getting increasingly dizzy and that started to worry me even more. I thought for sure I was going crazy. Surely thoughts of death was the first sign and that I was going downhill fast. I decided to just relax that Saturday and just wait things out. I ended up breaking down that day while watching a video titled “How to get over an Existential crisis”. As the guy talked about the step of getting over the fear of death, I thought about death more, and this consumed my body with panic and that deep feeling of emptiness. As I broke down, I asked my fiancée for help, finally. He was very shocked and taken back by how emotional I was. He thought I just needed to just cry it out and offered his shoulder to cry on. However, as I cried in his arms, (mind you, this was the hardest and deepest Ive ever cried before) I could tell I was headed for something bad if I didn’t seek help. But, I chose, again, to sit on the couch, relax, and take it easy and see how I felt later. As long as I didn’t move from my comfortable position on the couch underneath my weighted blanket, I was okay. However, when I would stand up to go to the bathroom, my mind would race and my legs and hands would start to shake and my chest felt like it was imploding in on itself and the feelings of utter terror felt like they were physically dragging me down. It felt like I was walking through thick mud and was trapped. Sunday came and went with me generally looking up videos on “ panic disorder”, “existential crisis”, and “midlife crisis”, and even “how to recover from burnout”. I stumbled across this video of an Irish woman who was a licensed therapist that worked with people suffering with panic attacks and anxiety. She demonstrated some techniques on how to reduce the fear behind the panic by hyperventilating and bringing on the symptoms of panic in order to tell yourself that these feelings would not harm me. After doing the exercise once I was in immediate temporary relief from the symptoms. I cried when I felt them subside, suddenly I found something that would help. And I clung to it like my life depended on it. I did it over and over and over and over that evening. It helped for a while. But then it was time to go to sleep again, and that brought on the panic of having to endure the next morning. As expected I woke up Monday morning realizing I was not going to be able to go to school because of how I was feeling. When I woke up that Monday morning, I felt the worst feeling of dread I have ever experienced in my life. I didn’t want to exist anymore, I felt like I could NOT go on. My knees buckled under the weight of my hopelessness and I broke down crying again. This time even harder and longer. My fiancée and I decided that I would be going to the doctor that day. He asked me if I could go by myself so that he could go to school since he is in his second year of medical school and was super stressed about his work load. I said yes, realizing all I needed to do was talk to someone and they would give me some medicine and then I would be fine. I walked in to the examination room and talked to a young black lady who was the nurse about my experience over the last couple of days. I told her about my thoughts of death, and how permanent that felt to me and my fear around that. Then I told her I had been having symptoms of panic and that I was just really scared and had no idea what to do now because I was in pharmacy school and didn’t know how to handle this and school. She so supportive and reassuring, telling me she had been there before as she has bipolar disorder. I cried again. This lady I just met was being so nice to me and reassuring me I was not alone. Then, she told me to hang tight and that she would be right back. Then another nurse comes and tells me that the are making me go to the emergency room. I was slightly confused as I never once told the nurse that I was having suicidal thoughts. She told me that when depressed patients bring up the ideas of death, that they are at risk for suicidial ideation and that I need to make sure I go the emergency room immediately. I walked out of the office so confused on why they wouldn’t help me, but I called my fiancée and told him what was going on. He said he only had a short time before his class was ending and that he would go with me after his class was over. I went home and change and waited, very anxiously, for him to get done.
When we got to the ER, I was immediately whisked back by a nurse who saw me in the waiting room. While we were walking back to my room, she leaned over and whispered “So……… thoughts of suicide?”. I was immediately angry at the nurse at the doctors’ office who had been so nice. She straight up told the nurse at the hospital I was having thoughts of suicide! Hello? I’m afraid of death, I don’t want to kill myself. I brushed it off as I was finally getting the help I thought I needed. However, I was slightly wrong. I didn’t realize this until way later. As soon as I stretched out in my hospital bed, 3 people came in to assess me. All while my head was spinning, I had to answer so many question about my health and how long had this been going on. I bet I had to recount the entire thing about 5 times. But, finally my doctor came in and reassured me that I had had my first run in with extreme anxiety with panic symptoms. He assured me that it was manageable and gave me a hydroxyzine and a Xanax to calm me down enough to go home and get some rest. I was discharged feeling GREAT. That Xanax work really quick and soon enough I was angry at myself for letting my mind go that far into despair. I am a fairly rational person, and am usually the one people go to for advice on deeper topics like self-esteem and confidence. But, I found myself to be a hypocrite. Why was this happening to me? Was I scared of school? Was I just legit going crazy? I had no idea what was going on and how I was going to handle this on top of going to school? I was terrified that school had broken me at this point, and the thought of going back scared me so much that I was willing to take a leave of absence based on medical issues. I wanted to run away from school as fast as possible. The stress of all of it had left me shattered on the floor. The next morning I went back to the doctor to clarify that I was not at all suicidal and wanted to talk to the doctor about the anxiety I had been feeling lately. I talked to the doctor and we both decided that it would be best if I started taking Lexapro 10mg once a day for the depression, and Wellbutrin XL 150mg once a day for my anxiety.
I decided I HAD to go back to classes on Wednesday because there were quizzes and tests I had to do so that I wouldn’t get left behind. While sitting in class, I was looking around me at the people in my class and could not feel the connection with anyone. I looked at my friends across the room at their assigned tables and felt I had never met them before. I was fear stricken the entire day. I was so afraid of what I was feeling, I shut down. As I went to lab, I could feel the panic streaking through again. In a flash, I could feel buzzes fly across my chest. I could physically here the buzzing in my ears and it was like I could only see the things that were in my direct line of sight. On the outside, I was just a little jumpy and sweaty. On the inside, however, I was fully experiencing World War III inside my own body. I stuck it out the whole day and call my fiancée trying to tell him I couldn’t do this. I explained to him that I was scared of what school was doing to my mental health and that I could take a leave of absence on the basis that my mental health was declining fast. He immediately responded with panic. We are both students living on our own and have no means of income instead of our loans we use to get by. How were we going to live with just one persons’ income? How was it fair to him that he pull all of the weight? How was he going to look after me, go to medical school, and provide the money necessary to live? I resisted and threw out excuses but deep down I knew he was right. But, in my head at the time, I really thought I was going crazy. And how in the hell was I suppose to continue school while Im this sick? So he suggested that I go to the doctor again and get some advice on what to do rather than to quit school. This started my deep dive in to learning about everything I could to help me along day to day in order to get better.
I went to school on Thursday fulling expecting panic attacks all day. And I was right. I went to lab again with a full panic episode and took breaks as often as I could to go to the bathroom and breath for a little while. This didn’t really help but it got me away from the staring eyes of my classmates. After school I went back to my apartment. My fiancée had not gotten back from school yet as I had left early because I didn’t have anything else pressing that day. As I sat on the couch, I stared at the wall trying to understand what was happening. I was still in fear from the car ride home where it felt like the car I was driving was going to collapse in on me. As I stared off, I started getting more and more fearful of what was happening. Thousands of questions were going through my mind about what was happening. What I really going crazy? Could I be in the process of dying? Was I having a heart attack? Had this triggered a psychotic break? Was I suppose to be expecting to hear voices now or see snakes in the room with me? Was I becoming increasingly paranoid of other peoples’ intentions toward me? All of these question in my head hit me like a ton of bricks several time over. So much so that I found myself on the floor of the bathroom dry heaving. I remember thinking, “I HAVE to do something about this. This can’t be right. I have to call someone.”. The only person that came to mind to call was my mom. She had always known how to calm me down sometimes in difficult situations. I quickly and with intense tremors, called my mother. I felt so much relief when I heard her voice on the other end. “Hello?” “What’s wrong?” “Are you okay?”. I wanted to explain so much. I wanted to tell her I was scared. I wanted to tell her everything that had happened in that very moment. But all I could get out was, “I need help.” I remember saying this while staring at my dark chestnut bathroom sink cabinet while on the floor in a fetal position. I had used my shirt as a pillow to keep my self comfortable. But I didn’t feel like I deserved it. My mom tried to gather as much information as she could but all I could say for about 3 minutes of the phone call was “I need help”. I know this scared her but I was at my lowest I’ve ever been. It was urgent. It was life threaten (or so it felt). I then told her, “just talk”. As she talked to me I felt more and more relief. I finally got up off of the floor and sat on the couch and just spilled my guts to her. I was so afraid of what she would think, but I didn’t care. I needed to tell someone. She was really sweet about everything as I cried, trying to apologize that I couldn’t handle my shit. She was in Oregon for my dads work and said she would get on the next flight and come help me. This alone brought me a little more relief.
Friday was not better, in fact it was exactly the same. Panic, anxiety, trapped feelings, disconnection, no appetite. By this point all I wanted to do was lay on the couch and not move for the rest of my life. I cried again that night and call my mother again. She reminded me she would be there with me the next week on that Saturday. I tried to pull it together and find out somethings that maybe would help. I researched until I could find some similarities to what I was going through. The first thing I came across was “panic disorder”. I was terrified. I would have to live with these symptoms for the rest of my life? No…. I couldn’t…… I couldn’t live like this everyday. I refused to believe it. What would help patients with panic disorder? Exercise. That was what I was going to do to help. I walked around our entire apartment complex for 30 mins a day to see if it would help. I also found journaling and meditation. I tried those things every day and everything was still the same. I changed trajectories with my diagnosis and thought maybe it is just really bad anxiety and I wouldn’t have to live with these panic symptoms forever. But, I remember trying to get out of my apartment that weekend and thinking to myself, “Are you paranoid of other peoples intentions?” “People are looking at you”, “What if you were going through a paranoid mental break?”. It was like a scary movie that never ended. I went to target to try and get some fruit, which seemed like the only thing I could eat without wanting to throw up. I remember walking through target with flashes of panic streaking throughout my body and feeling so uncomfortable and scared about what was going on with me. I got my groceries and quickly left. I told my fiancée about the experience and he suggested that I actively tell myself that I am not going crazy. That seemed to be the primary thought that was scaring me so much. And of course, like I always do, I researched “going crazy”. This time though, it actually helped. Whatever resource I used, it stated that, “If you have to question if you’re going crazy, you’re probably not going crazy.” It explained how people that actually have problems with different realities and hallucinations, both auditory and visually, normally feel as if they are real and don’t notice that its out of their ordinary life. They simply can’t see, “if they are going crazy” or not. It was crude, but it worked. I worked on that idea for a couple of days and it really worked. I was slightly better, and when I say slightly, I mean slightly. The panic flashes weren’t as intense, but they were still there. I decided to continue to walk around the apartment again as the effects weren’t going to be immediate. However, the only way I kept myself from panicking while I walked was listening to motivational videos. And it had to be continuous. As soon as one video would be over, I would have to quickly choose another or I would be in my head again and going on a downward spiral. At several moments, I would look at the different trees around and just glance at some of the cars in their assigned parking spot and I wouldn’t think they were real. It was like I was seeing them, but from a perspective I couldn’t place. And of course, this frightened me. WHAT WAS HAPPENING? This central theme continued, even when my mother had gotten to my apartment to help with things. I would go to school, come back, cry, try to explain my feelings and then go to sleep. I couldn’t get a grip on things. 
One night I got home and was crying and felt so overwhelmed with dealing with all of these emotions and feelings that I tried to get some emotional support from my mother and she cracked. She was mentally drained from worrying about me so often that she decided to tell me to call my dad for help. I totally understood and called my father. He gave me some practical advice. “Just let that shit go, son” I laughed inside feeling like that was utter nonsense because that’s what I had been trying to do all along. But when I thought about it, I was so caught up in all of these fears associated with what was going on. All of those question were still swirling around in my head and I decided right then to just let it go….. it was as if an elephant standing steadfast on my chest had finally lifted his leg. I could feel my body changing in response to this new idea of letting my fears go. I came out of the room and to my mom’s surprise, she noticed color back in my face. I walked out of the room with hope. I could work on letting all of my fears go and try to get better. 
With this newfound hope I was going to be dedicated in finding solutions. I scoured the internet for anything and everything that could possibly help people with what I was going through. Yoga, meditation, diet, exercise, supplements, sleep hygiene, no sugar, low carb, keto diet, journaling, radical acceptance, therapy, CBT therapy, ECT therapy. I looked at everything and watched 10 videos on every topic to find what was going to work. I made it my mission to find a plan that was going to work for me. I finally narrowed it down to meditation, yoga, journaling, and my diet. For the next couple of weeks, this is what I did as well as try to find myself a therapist. I did yoga a couple of days and journaled and cried because I was overwhelmed and walked and tried to start eating more. I could feel myself slowly getting better but it was as if I was getting better centimeters at a time. Recovery was moving painfully slow and I would often get really overwhelmed and frustrated at myself. I wanted to just sleep ALL the time. I remember one day my mother wanted us to go to the casino just to get out and do something. I had a great time with her that night. However, the next day I was so physically and emotionally drained I slept literally all day and all night until the next morning. I only got up to use the bathroom and eat a little. In mid December, I was starting to get better. I would have maybe 2-3 good days followed by really bad days. We even decided to go to Arkansas to see a friend for a week and everyday I was there was a bad day. I tried to make the most of it, but the awareness of the physical sensations and the irrational fears were to strong to ignore or handle all of the time. Often I would wake up already shaking from anxiety. My jaw would be so clenched my teeth would chatter. I would be freezing and already dreading the day ahead. 
After we got back from Arkansas, things got slightly better. And I finally had found a therapist. Her name is Amanda. She’s about 4 foot 11 inches tall but she packs a punch when she notices a bad habit of mine or a bad label I have about myself. I have always had a great preconception of therapy. My friends always spoke highly of it. We all thought everyone needed therapy. So I was really excited to talk to Amanda about what was going on in my life. For me, it seemed like if I were to talk to my fiancée or my mother about anything and everything that was going on in my head, it would just make them worry about me even more. That worry would negatively effect their days and cause them more stress than was needed. So I appreciated Amanda. I was thankful she was available. The first session was just the intake session and she seemed super sympathetic and listened to me word vomit all over her. I even think at one point, she said, “Okay, this is just the intake day.” I was spouting out all of my problems already. But it seemed like I couldn’t help it. Words just came flowing out. About my family dynamic, my parents, my love life, my past traumas, the irrational thoughts in my head, what had been going on the month, my fears….. everything. She documented everything she deemed necessary and sent me on my way, telling me that therapy was a process and that change is not going to happen quickly. I was fully aware of this. After the intake session I was on a euphoric high. I had gotten a lot of stuff off of my chest and I felt like I could float away. It felt like for the first time, someone had actually listened to me. My whole life I had been the one people come to to listen to their problems and try and help with whatever they were going through, but I hadn’t had anyone to do that for me. Everyone seemed to be so caught up in their lives to have time for me. Because I was the irresponsible one or my problems felt childish to them. But Amanda just sat there and listened. She listened to EVERYTHING and didn’t judge me for anything. She corrected my language here and there when I would label myself badly but, for the most part she was sympathetic. I read somewhere that therapy was a place for the people who talk to listen, and for the people that listen to talk. I was the latter. I had been so preoccupied from listening to everyone that I forgot to assert myself when I needed someone to listen to me. That was Amanda.
After the first therapy session, I was hopeful. For the first time since the beginning of this all, I was hopeful that this wouldn’t last forever. Those were my worst fears. That this would now be forever. That pharmacy school had triggered something that would now be a forever thing for me. For the next couple of weeks I would stick to what I knew worked, or at least somewhat worked. Yoga, meditation, journaling, getting my appetite back up, these were all things I thought were going to get me back to normal. I continued to search and search and search for self help information. I probably watched 1000 videos and read even more articles on every symptom and anything that would help them. I tried out supplement, vitamins, routines, sleep hygiene, light therapy, and anything little thing I could do to help at least a little. I noticed that in the mornings, my anxiety would be super extreme and then get progressively better. At night, it would feel as if I had never been anxious before in my life. I got scared to fall asleep because I didn’t want to deal with the morning anxiety. What was most distressing was my heart palpitations. I would wake up and suddenly feel like I was in the middle of running a marathon, sweating, breathing faster, super tense and could hear the vibrations of my body. I had to try to get a handle on this. I looked up some solutions and read that some patients who experience anxiety from the sensations usually are more fearful of the heart palpitations. Doctors usually can prescribe a beta blocker like metoprolol or propranolol to reduce the heart rate and without the heart palpitations, the anxiety and panic symptoms would decrease naturally. So, that’s what I thought my best option would be. I went back to my doctor and talk to her about all of this and she agreed. I was put on a low dose 12.5mg of metoprolol. After the first dose I could notice the effects the next morning. I was super anxious but I wasn’t in a panic. I was so thankful for this because it allowed me to breath in the mornings without feeling to fearful.
It was Christmas break finally and I wanted to use this break to refresh and try to work harder on myself. The break was filled with setbacks and nights of crying from being overwhelmed. But they were also filled with random moments of intense love and joy as well. I noticed one night, while snuggling with my dog, a huge sense of love for him. I spent probably 30 minutes straight just cuddling him and hugging him. For weeks, my body and spirit had been stripped of my ability to feel anything. The love for my fiancée was gone, my sense of humor, my enjoyment of the thing I normally enjoyed, I couldn’t even feel the love for my sweet dog Teddy. But at this moment, I basked in this feeling. I didn’t want it to end. I missed this feeling so much. But I knew it would fade, so I stayed with it as long as possible. 
New year’s was even better. I spent New Year’s Eve with amazing friends and family. We played card games and board games and popped fireworks. We even bought lanterns that flew up in the air when you lit a candle underneath them and wrote all the things we wanted to leave in the past and all the things we wanted to bring into the new year. We all cried at the things we realized were holding us back and made a symbolic gesture to really do better this year and “let that shit go”. It was funny how my dads quote seemingly came into certain aspects of all of this. As the new year hit, I was hopeful again. I was having more good days than bad days. However, there were other things that were still bothering me. There was an extremely uneasy feeling I would get from time to time. Mainly on the car rides to school. It was that damn derealization. I HATED feeling like this. At random moments throughout the day I was SO aware of…..reality. Like, I knew I was a human and we are all humans, and all just doing things to fill the day and go to bed at night. It was as if I was a robot with no emotion, strictly actions. Or that, at times, it felt there was no point to anything we ever did. And for me, it scared me more than anything. Then there was the tension headaches, moments of extreme fatigue, morning depression, and anxiety. I was going to wait and see if things got better as time progressed. 
I started class finally and cried the day before and the day of school. I felt an overwhelming sense of anxiety the whole day of school. That same sense of disconnectedness that scared me to begin with. I was there all over again. I needed to get out…. So I left early that first day. I told my friend that I was leaving early because I thought I was going to start crying in class. She understood and told me to feel better. I got home and balled my eyes out. I didn’t want this anymore. I didn’t want to go through life feeling like this anymore. I was overwhelmed. I felt like my relationship was slipping, my grade were inevitably going to slip, my friend were pulling away, and I was going to be stuck like this forever. But after a talk with my fiancée he assured me he was not going anywhere and that I had made tons of progress and that I couldn’t forget that. He always knew how to calm me down and rationalize everything I was worried about. I always forgot about the progress I’ve made while I’m in one of those anxiety states. I would try to remember the phrase, “trust the process”. It usually calmed me down because it gave me a sense that it wasn’t going to be like this forever. I went to sleep dreading the morning and more so going to school the next day. I went to sleep like I normally did since I developed a night time routine. I started taking melatonin at 9pm so that I would be super tired by 10pm. In between 9pm and 10pm was my “buffer zone” I started journaling and reading during that hour, which I really enjoyed now. My fiancée got me into reading and I started to fall in love with fantasy books. So I journaled about my day on some nights and read the “Mistborn” series on the other nights. I even found a couple of prompted gratitude and anxiety journal I really like. Then I would listen to a wind down meditation that was 10 minutes that relied on me consciously relaxing all of my muscles, or turning them off for the night. It helped me fall asleep quicker. I hated the fact that it usually would take me an hour or more to fall asleep every night, so I wanted to change that. I developed a night routine that I really enjoyed and looked forward to. My days and nights were slowly filling with things I truly enjoyed and looked forward to. I started drinking green tea (decaf), eating oatmeal in the mornings, listening to inspirational videos, eating more fruit, and writing. I never knew how great writing would feel. I think throughout my life, I never had the privacy that I needed to write whatever I wanted. If I ever had a journal when I was younger, my mother always found it and read it. I got so embarrassed by one of the journal entries that my mom confronted me about that I never wrote in one again. Now that I had complete trust in my fiancée not reading my journals, I had the freedom I always craved to write down my unbridled emotions about the day without the fear of someone judging me. It was my outlet that was always going to agree with me, never look at me like I’m weird, or pass me off as childish or irresponsible. With my night time routine in place, I took that night as any other night and finally went to sleep. I woke up the next morning fully expecting to cry and find some excuse not to go to school and stay home in bed, but those thoughts never came. I was kind of excited to see my friends again. So my goal that day was to stay the whole day at school no matter how scared I was. I got to school expecting so much to happen. Panic, anxiety, disconnection, nausea, and even sadness…….but nothing. I was fine. I was able to concentrate in class and occasionally go to the bathroom to breathe and think. It wasn’t a perfect day, but I made it all day. I ended the school day with the panicky idea that I was trapped at school, which sucked because I had made it so far and I was already back to panic. But it didn’t last too long, maybe an hour or two. I got home and did some yoga and was back to, somewhat, normal. The next few days of school were okay, but I made it all day and continued to progress. I started noticing more and more everyday. One thing was, I was actually starting to…..enjoy pharmacy school again. I remember sitting in my Immunology class, really engaged and concentrated. I was getting back into my groove and was loving it. My therapist was thrilled about all of this. 
Now we come to today, January 23rd-ish 2020. My days are filling with a little worry about was symptoms I’m feeling. The only symptoms I feel now are very slight feelings of derealization, which are scary still, but don’t last near as long, maybe 20 minutes or so; tension headaches, small amounts of fatigue and sleepiness, and still that damn morning depression. I’ve shamefully skipped a couple of days of class due to the morning depression, but I’m still working on that. I still journal when I want and meditate every night. I also do yoga, not as often as I want, but I’m planning on starting back soon when my schedule gets a little less hectic. I have things I’m looking forward to as well. Im moving down to the coast soon with my fiancée and starting with a fresh new city. Im a couple of months away from my introductory rotations as a student pharmacist. I’m going to be living in the same apartment complex as my 3 friends from school and im so excited to be able to hang out with them more and spend more time with the people that mean the most to me. I want to start focusing on that more as well as diving deeper into the things that excite me about my career. Research is one of my passions and I am set up to start working with a professor of mine next term and I am beyond excited about that. She is someone I look up to and would love for her to be my mentor. I want to look on the positive side of things more and be way more gratuitous about the things I already have. Most of last year was focused on the things that I didn’t have and wanted and all the things my life lacked. I was so unappreciative of the things around me. I can’t believe I am saying this, but I kind of appreciate what happened to me. It really has opened my eyes to the things that are most important in life.

They only want to talk about themselves and relate everything back to them. They do this to make themselves feel better about themselves, not caring if it hurts anyone else.

And I hate it! People are so egotistical and selfish that it's hard to feel sympathy for them. All they do is complain about the day and you have to listen and try to help them. BUT GUESS WHAT?!? They dont even care! They aren't going to take your advice and they are going to keep complaining about everything. 

It's so invalidating. Like when you try to get close to them and open up to them about your past and then they try to relate it back to themselves and try to show you how they had it worse then you. They then try and prove how you're just a pathetic emotional loser who cant get over anything.

It's annoying. I hate it. 
Also, random, off track thing: I hate it when other's cry for no reason. I know it can be because of multiple factors, but seeing others cry and others help then just hurts. No one ever helped me when I cried, so I just hold it in and deal with it later.  And most of the time it just feels fake. Crying is natural, but it's so strange to see others do. And above all, I cant help others when they cry because I hold in my emotions.

Anyways, back on track, it's just so annoying when you try so hard everyday to make it through and to keep your ""happy, supportive, motherly"" mask on just to make others feel better. You do this in order for others not to hurt you or try and get too close. Yet, at the end of the day, it still hurts when all the people you've helped support and been nice to isn't there to help. They leave you the instant you open up and say ""depression"" even when they have it themselves. Maybe it's because they aren't emotionally capable to handle other's emotion, but I'm also not emotionally capable and yet they try and tell me everything. I like it, but I also hate only being a listener and advice giver. I want to help them but it's impossible when they dont want to get help. I know that this is common for most people, but it hurts a lot when people do it.


I hate it. And I wear this mask of my false self everyday. I just want to go away and deal with my own stuff,  but it seems like everyone is just trying to tie me into their stuff. Everyday I hate myself a little bit more, and it's before long going to get horribly worse. But that's just me, it probably doesnt matter in the grand scheme of things and I've probably done the very things I mentioned before. 



Sorry for the long vent, but I had to get this off my chest. I don't hate helping others, but it can really be a struggle when they dont want to help themselves and when your depression is taking over your life at the same time (with you having no actual support system to get you through your depression too, of course). Some people are kind, and I apologize for sounding insensitive and grouping everyone together.

Never dated/kissed, or been even slightly romantically involved with a girl. I've been rejected 4 or 5 times but that isnt what scares me. 

What scares me is if a girl I like is interested in me. I've had it happen before with girls I wasnt interested in and that's a different problem. I usually just ignore them or if they are persistent I'll let them know I'm not interested. 

However, if a girl I was interested in liked me back I would be filled with fear. I dont know what the next move would be and I'd be in shock. 

I feel like I'm not relationship material. I'm really not a good person and I'm practically autistic if I'm not using a persona to fit in. My real self is arrogant, borderline psychotic, and depraved. I have disgusting thoughts and fantasies I cant even share in this post. I have crazy thoughts about society and history and I'm constantly theorizing weird possibilities in my head. It makes for decent conversation with no one but it's the stuff I really like to think about. I've never found a person male or female I can really connect with who seems to think about the same things I do. I'm afraid I cant get too specific because I feel like the post would get taken down. 

Besides my brain, my physical body is disgusting to me. I'm not horribly overweight (6'1, 215lb, 25.5% body fat), but I definitely hate the way I look and cant stand to look at myself in a mirror. Besides that I have a small penis (4.9 inches) which looks really awful since I'm quite tall. 

I'm not a Neet or something to that affect. I work and go to school full time and I plan to be a teacher. Part of the reason I want to teach is because I dont think I'll ever be able to get married and have a family and I'd like to shape people's lives in some way. That's a defining characteristic for me, existential dread. 

Still, I'm afraid of being alone in life. I never feel fulfilled by the relationships I currently have. A lot of my close family has passed away recently and the rest is distant from me. My friends are accepting of me because they themselves have pretty major flaws that cause them to be outcasts of one sort or another. Mostly we just sit around and smoke weed on our free time, which we dont have much of. 

Getting a girlfriend would probably not help this at all. I realize that. And I know I wouldnt be able to trust her deep down and I'd probably grow bitter towards her. I know even some of the most passionate relationships burn out because people cant work together to keep it. I fear my existential depression would cause me to have a crisis and try to do all of the things I havent been able to growing up as an awkward outcast. 

When I look into my future I only see things getting harder. My biggest fear is dying with no one saying I affected them positively and I still dont know how to really be fulfilled in that. 

But I also fear not having a relationship and how it is affecting me. Right now I have extreme anxiety about sex to the point that even masturbating has become an unenjoyable activity. I dont like where my thoughts go and I dont like how afterwards I feel like I want to kill myself. Still the compulsion takes over and I'll do it at least a few times a week. Just imagining myself in bed with a woman is a humiliating act that makes me want to cry. 

I talk to girls with relative ease and I'm not shy around them. Most of them find me to be quite normal because I make sure they do.

My girlfriend of two years left me on January 4th, she said she just needed some time to herself and I wanted to give that to her because I felt like she would come back to me like we’ve always come back to each other in the past. She’s my absolute best friend and really the only person who has ever truly understood me and made me feel really loved. She ended up telling me a few days ago that a guy she went to hang out with from work, she caught feelings for, and had sex with him. She also had been on tinder, and met some guy that took her to a movie, when I’ve had a gift card for a month now and she never seemed like she wanted to see anything. That guy ended up giving her a hickey that I found out about by seeing it, and took her to a rodeo that I couldn’t afford to go to. She says she doesn’t talk to him anymore, but yesterday she started matching with guys on tinder again. We’re still in contact, because I still love her, and she’s still my best friend, but she’s told me she doesn’t want to get back with me again and it’s just breaking my heart. We’ve been through so much together and I was ready to propose to her. I had a ring picked out and everything. I was going to ask her on Valentine’s day. Take her back to the place we met, ask a photographer friend to take pictures of us and tell her I want to take valentines day photos, then when she’s not expecting it get on a knee and ask her. I had everything planned out and I was ready. I wanted to propose in less than a month from today, but I guess I was too late.

My college, I’ll call SW, needed a tax return from my parents, which I gave them, and now they have no record of it and the books for that financial year are closed so my scholarship won’t pay out for it. Unless I can get $4,500 to pay it off, I can’t go back to SW. I could get into UM, but I would need my SW transcript to transfer and I can’t get that with that balance on my account. I could enroll as a freshman, but I would need my high school transcript with at least a 2.5GPA, which I don’t think I had.

My job is a student position at a very well known place that I absolutely love working at. I can’t name it or give an acronym because it’s just known worldwide and I don’t want to give anything out. I absolutely love working for this place, but since it’s a student position, they need verification that I’m in college, which I can’t give. So odds are, when I wake up in 7 hours, I’ll head to work and have my last day there, as the deadline for that verification was Tuesday, and I just haven’t been in all week out of fear of losing my job.

I’m at a point where I really, really need the pain to end. I want to die but I won’t kill myself because I don’t really want to die, I just want to stop hurting. I don’t want to hurt my parents or my, I guess now my ex, because I love them too much to do that to them. I have a suicide note written and hidden away so I have the comfort in knowing that I could go at any time if I really, truly felt like it.

I haven’t been in counseling in over a year now, because my counselor was just condescending and I honestly felt like my depression was gone, and I was seriously happy ever since I met my girlfriend, my ex, my whatever she is to me. Now I don’t remember what I’m supposed to do to cope and I feel like I’m drowning. I swear if she told me she wanted me again, if she truly wanted me back, I would take her back in a heartbeat. Nobody knows everything we’ve been through or how special she truly is to me, and I can look past this horrible month that we’ve had if it means having a real future together.

I don’t know. A part of my feels exactly like that, that I would take her back in a heartbeat, but another part of me knows that I shouldn’t accept what she’s done, and I should move on. But I don’t want to accept that.

I can't even start my favorite game anymore without losing motivation before it loads.  
Even making music isn't fun anymore. Nothing makes me excited, nothing I can do in a day gives me that push to do stuff or feel rewarded for doing so.

The one friend that I have is annoyed because I have no one else to go to.  
I never really got to meet anybody when I went to school, I've always been the outcast.

I'm honestly struggling to find a reason to keep going. It hurts me to know no matter how hard I try I'll never amount to any of my dreams and that I'm really doing all this for nothing, towards no bigger picture, no goal other than for my heart to inevitably stop.

My parents were never nice, always had to answer questions in a snotty or rude manner.  
They would tell me how much of a piece of shit I am, and yell at me harder for trying or failing.  
So I gave up, the last sheet of homework I've done was in 6th grade.

long time lurker, first time poster. i’m on a throwaway because i don’t want to offend anyone in my personal life. i also apologize for how awful this formatting is going to be because i’m typing this on my phone. 

to start off, I’m 19 &amp; F. my mom met my dad and they went on like two dates a week for a year and then got pregnant with me. Then they got married and now they hate each other and I hate coming home from college to have to listen to screaming matches. my mom has unresolved anger management issues and we’ve never gotten along because she believes that my mental illnesses are more taxing on her than me. she’s also been telling me my whole life that i was fat and i needed to watch what i ate. when i was in third grade, she would taunt me every time she saw me eating chips. one time i wanted a cosmic brownie and she threw the whole box on the floor and stomped on them. my dad has switched off between alcohol and prescription painkillers and he’s a gambling addict. when i was 6 years old, i remember my dad coming in drunk and stumbling and slurring his words. then he and my mom started screaming at each other and he threw a plate of food at her in some kind of drunken rage and she kicked him out. they’re still together though. 

now for my issues.. i’ve always struggled with my weight because of my mom. i’ve been overweight since i was a toddler. and significantly overweight. i lost the weight when i turned 18. i went from 212 to 138 and i’m still not happy and i don’t think i’m ever going to be. i will never have the body i want without cosmetic surgery. i have broad shoulders and narrow hips and bird legs. i have the least feminine shape a girl can have. i’m also not very pretty and looking in mirrors is really hard for me now because i cry if i look to long. i don’t think it matters how much weight i lose because i think i’m always going to be a fat, pig with the type of body i have. now i have a fucked up relationship with food and i switch between eating too much and not eating at all. my mom told me i’m getting too skinny but i already know that isn’t true and i don’t appreciate her lying to me because she wants to be thinner than me. (side note: she always made losing weight a competition bc she would fluctuate between chubby and thin). And if i was too skinny, you wouldn’t be the only one who saw it. nobody else thinks that. 

this lead to the bullying i had to deal with 3rd-11th grade. i’m bipolar so a lot of kids didn’t understand why i would cry over nothing or when i would get really angry and yell in class. and they certainly weren’t shy about making fun of my weight. i didn’t have any friends until my freshman year of high school. 

i was raped twice. the first time is when i lost my virginity. i was 17 and i met another 17 year old on Tinder. we met up and he asked if i wanted to get in the back. i went with it. prior to this, i had little to no experience with guys. i kissed two people and they both were stage kisses. i’ve never had a boyfriend, even to this day. he got on top of me and asked if i was ready and i didn’t say anything for a minute and he just pushed into me. and it hurt. the second time was when i drank too much at a party and he took me back to his apartment. he told me we would just make out and then it didn’t end like that. there are so many fucked up, disgusting details with that one and i don’t really want to relive the details right now. then i cried and he kicked me out and i walked back to my dorm at like 3:00 am. nobody has ever loved me before. i’ve never loved anyone before. i’m so delayed in romantic maturity because i never got to experience it. i will never get to have “young love”. i will never get to have a high school sweetheart. and i’m almost 20. pretty fucking pathetic. but it’s also partially my choice which you’ll hear about in a second 

i started self harming in fourth grade. i learned it from another girl in my class. she told me she would scratch her inner wrists when she felt bad. so that’s what i started doing. my wrists looked raw and i would scratch til i bled. then i moved onto cutting myself in eighth grade and that continued until my senior year of high school. i had a suicide attempt my junior year of high school and the hospital told my mom they thought it was just a way of getting attention, a “cry for help” if you will. i burned my wrist after i got raped the second time but i’ve been clean since then. i get urges but i normally can control that now. 

then i started to get into drugs and alcohol. i had my first drink my freshman year. it was a fruit punch wine cooler at a family party and that was that lol. then my sophomore year i had my first edible and i’ve never loved a feeling more. i was so happy and giggly and it felt so good. then i started to actually smoke weed. it became a regular habit my junior year which is when the drinking became a regular habit too. i love getting fucked up. i love how i feel even though i know that’s wrong. but then i started smoking all day, every day which made me steal money from my mom to get it, i’d steal out of my college savings to get it. i just used my textbook money to get it. weed isn’t physically addictive but it can ruin your life. now i do molly, coke, etc. one of my most humiliating moments is when i went to the bathroom during my theatre lecture to hit my wax pen. i hit it too many times and i came back to class and fell asleep on my desk. like my head full on hit the desk. and i try to quit drinking and smoking but then i start to get panicky when i don’t have it. i can’t eat and i’m on edge and i can’t sleep. i’m dry right now and i’ve slept 8 hours in 4 days. 

finally, i’m a whore. i’ll sleep with pretty much anyone. my body count is embarrassing. i get made fun of a lot for it. i partially choose not to be in relationships because i feel like i’m going to be co-dependent and i know that’s terrible and that’s why i’m staying away so i don’t have to put someone through that. i sleep with guys and then if they keep talking to me i catch feelings. then they ghost me and tell me to hop off and then i can’t get out of bed for two days because every relationship i’ve ever even gotten close to has ended because i’m the problem. i’m a lot to deal with and i don’t think somebody would want to show off their girlfriend that’s known for being easy. 

i really needed to get that off of my chest. thanks for listening.",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,593540,public,confidence,self,"TW: depression, suicide, rape, bullying, substance abuse, self harm &amp; eating disorders",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/et63f5/tw_depression_suicide_rape_bullying_substance/,no_ads,0.0

 I’m very clingy and have a hard time believing people actually like me or love me/have a feeling people are out to get me

Have a hard time letting go of what people say to me especially if it’s hurtful 
Very jealous and get annoyed by people often especially when they “copy/steal idea’s or things I say”
Very over observant could notice anything from different tone to noticing people walking around me
Often have auditory processing problems from hearing things/ hearing people say things 
Have troubles of not being over sensitive could cry over someone getting mad at me for nothing 
Often change how I feel about certain people throughout the days 
Often get startled easy and paranoid if people are talking about me 
Low self esteem

Therapy doesn’t help, I’ve had extensive medical tests done on me (both for this and other reasons) all of which were inconclusive, friends and family try to help but can’t relate or understand, and I feel like nothing has purpose anymore.

Trying to keep a smile but its not going so well.

I just don’t understand it when someone isn’t behaving as they normally do that normally means something is wrong. The problem with this is people only do something if they care about you.

Why am i so hated? so disgusted? Someone’s personality recently flipped on me and i don’t waste time and i ask “ hey what’s up why are you much more hostile to me? did i do somethjng wrong?” I get halfed baked answer of “ no” So i don’t waste time to immediately destroy them. 

Yet i stil don’t understand why am i so hated? I have hatred, grudges, and nefarious plans against everyone i dislike, but i don’t act upon it because im all about peace and harmony. If i can just sit down and enjoy my time im ok and do what i do but when you disrupt my balance i demand answers. Still don’t know why.

Past Experiences
- some guy didn’t like that i was flirtatious when i was younger. said i still am because he believes i am. so he basically treats me like slut. so i destroyed him
- someone  thought i wasn’t their friend cause i didn’t hear them say hi to me on a windy noisy far away day. she started being a bitch to me. i immediately destroyed her as soon as she said “ i thought we weren’t friends anymore” because she decided to act on her opinions instead of finding answers
- some guy forcefully bragged some stupid shit in my face. i destroyed him instantly and made him into a husk.

I don’t understand why im so forgetable. All i do is work hard, playful jokes, bossy, a great ally, reach my hand out, act independently. I don’t understand why am i so hated?

Am i too different? I don’t remember people’s name easily. They get offended and mad because i don’t know their name. I tell them “ anyone csn read a name tag, but only those who care about you will know who you are” i essentially value them as an individual not by a label. Yet they are still mad.

Times like this makes me wonder why bother? They are just going to hate me in the end. That’s the cycle. That’s the way things have to be.

I learn to stand on my own, but i can’t say it doesn’t hurt seeing people get together, make connections, etc

Obviously it’s nice not hating myself but the fact that I’m hurting other people makes me hate myself even more in the long run.

Honestly I’d rather just suffer the hatred of myself then hurt other people so I’ll probably just stick with that unless I can find a way to stay in the middle of the two and find balance.

I’ve battled with depression for a while, and although it seemed like things were getting better for me, I’d always somehow fall back into the deepest fucking pit. I don’t know why I started feeling this way, maybe I just felt like I didn’t belong in the world and I couldn’t see my purpose of being alive. I think being bullied in elementary/middle school definitely had something to do with it. I almost killed myself at 4 in the morning when I was 14 because I couldn’t handle it anymore. I didn’t end up doing it because I thought about my family and how much it’d hurt them. Looking back at it now, I just can’t help but think why the fuck did I want to end my life at 14 years old. How hard could it have been compared to what I’m going through now?

Moving forward, high school was a roller coaster in regards to my battle with depression. I was hospitalized a couple times for having severe episodes and panic attacks, but I always came back from them and never contemplated suicide. Senior year was extremely difficult for me though. I began using drugs as a coping mechanism after I found out my mother was diagnosed with cancer and I felt like my world was falling apart. My depression was the worst it’s ever been and I hid from it by being high all the time. I refused to feel anything and I just wanted to disappear. I also lost all of my faith in God senior year. I didn’t believe anymore, I was a drug addict, my mom had cancer, and I wanted to die. This was by far the worst year of my fucking life, but I somehow got through it, hoping college would be better.

The beginning of college wasn’t too bad, I made new friends and enjoyed the freedom that came with living away from my family. I stopped using and tried to treat my mental illness. I was in a better mental state until spring semester came along. I started talking to this guy, and we got really close really fast. I lost my virginity to him and then he stopped talking to me and ended things. It was a really hard time for me, but I was able to get through it. Fast forward a couple weeks and he happens to be at the same club I’m at one night with all his friends. That night, I was sexually assaulted by one of his best friends. I fell into my pit again and I really didn’t think I’d be able to get out. I was in an awful mental state all of spring/summer semester, and I honestly don’t think I’ve fully recovered from it. Right now, my best friend has to have an extremely invasive surgery and all I wanna do is be there for her but I can barely be here for myself. 

Anyways, I just feel lost right now and no matter how hard I try to move forward, I feel like I’m stuck in this everlasting fucking cycle of pain. I don’t understand why all this shit has happened to me and every time I think I’m recovering, something comes around to tear me apart. I’m sick of hearing the “things get better” bullshit because even though they do, everything will eventually fall back down and get worse.

I do take anti depressants. I have ADHD and OCD along with epilepsy so it's hard for me to remember things . 
I also see a counselor for myself and my daughter, as she does act out sexually. 

I really have no excuses other than it's hard to stay on tasks. But I am working hard daily to make small improvements. 

My daughter comes home and asks me to touch her. Every Sunday . Monday. Tuesday sometimes. 
Tells me that someone tickles her bum. And hurts her. 
And I hate hearing it. I hate it. It kills me. 
And I can't do a goddamn thing about it because it's easier to sympathize with a man saying a woman with mental health issues is trying to alienate his child than to investigate abuse. 

This man used to rape me. I swore to my family up and down he would never do that to her. But a few weeks ago he did it to me again when I thought we could work things out. 

I'm thinking to myself.... what if it is him???
That's his daughter. 
I'm completely upset about it. I never thought it was him until he did it to me again and I feel like a fucking idiot. 

I'm completely stuck. I live on a reservation where 1 in 3 native American women experience rape in their lifetime. So it's not uncommon. Our child protection services is not up to our neighboring communities standards. 

For the longest time I thought it was maybe the other child in their family that was also being abused or the grandmother. 
But it makes me sick - I literally fucked everything up by not being organized enough, not reaching out for help, not knowing what I was doing or getting myself into, not doing the right thing when I thought I was doing the right thing. I can't fucking stop it. I can't get my daughter to stop saying those things. I can't get her to stop asking for it. She doesn't know what's wrong. She doesn't know someone is hurting her. 

She was in diapers when it started and I feel stupid for trusting the reasons they gave me when she was sore looking and had bruises or bite marks. 
I'm a complete naive idiot and feel so guilty. 
Some days are good. I workout. I eat. Interact with people. 
Other days I am a zombie and stare at my phone or tv all day- when my daughter isn't here I have nothing at all. I do nothing at all. 

And I cry often. 
It's because of me. My lack of everything. I brought this all upon myself. I could have stopped this if I only did the right things first but I didn't. I made the choice to stay with a guy who raped me all the time and have a baby with him. 
This depression is different. It's literally me facing all my failures that I brought upon myself. 

I'm not like this everyday. I do the whole positive thinking and aware of thoughts. But tonight. I know she has to go back. And I know she will come home and say and do the same thing. And it hurts. She trusted me when she told me the first time ""Mummy someone hurt my peepee"" and I failed her. My little baby. Who could barely speak at the time told me. 
I don't know how many times she has told me. And she trusted me. And I failed her. 
I've had a psychologist and a counselor tell me her behaviours are not normal. The Child Protection Service Worker also said it wasn't normal but nothing gets done with them.


It's hard not to feel guilty. It's hard not to blame myself and it's hard to overcome depression when I'm in this situation.

Did you put a camera in my bathroom?” She then pushed me out of the bathroom doorway and I began to cry and I felt like I was about to throw up. 6 minutes later and she opens the door again, pushes me out of the way and runs to her bedroom, I follow after her calling her a “pervert, pedophile- ect.” She locks her room *assuming she was hiding the camera* and I told her I was going to call the cops, she then comes into my room and takes my phone saying “you’re grounded for calling me a pedophile.” I can’t really remember what happened after that, I probably cried for awhile. 

When I used her shower, she sometimes took the towel out of the bathroom and put it in her bedroom and said “I’ll be in the kitchen.” I yelled for her to bring to me, “why can’t you just bring it to me?” She ignored me. She had a camera hidden in her room so he could see me naked. 
(He did a few times before I realized what was going on)

Also- she had replaced her bathroom shower curtain to be see through, because “there was bugs in it, and it’s all we could afford.” I found multiple hidden cameras in her bathroom. I took SO MANY showers in that bathroom. 

This one time she told me to spread my legs in her room, “to check how far along my puberty is” she said “don’t worry the camera isn’t on.” 
I didn’t spread my legs.

My body means nothing, and I have no value.

Overcast skies, rainy.  It reminded me of the day I broke my arm.

Driving into work this afternoon, all I could think about is when I broke my arm on the monkey bars in elementary school.  The teacher and coach took a look and told me to shake it off.

Looking back on that makes me so upset that I sat through an entire afternoon in pain.  Not a single person took the initiative to call my parents.  They all thought I was being overdramatic.

My mom picked me up that day and rushed me to the pediatrician who confirmed it was broken.  They put it in a splint, but I'd have to wait until next week for a proper cast.

Sometimes I think about that experience, which it just spirals from there into thinking about the bullies who tormented me then the teachers and administrators who did nothing.  I suspect this is all because of a post I read last night that triggered some of my childhood memories.

To the present... My ex wants minimal interaction with him, we're separated, and I'm living in a spare room at my parents house with my son in another.  I got home today, and my mom told me how much of a fuck up I am while I'm trying to organize the child custody documents, and now I can't stop crying.  

I already know how messed up I am, I don't need a reminder.  That is not want I needed when I got home.

I've experienced spmething similar a couple years ago when I had some eating related issues, but I hadn't really been in this deep of a rut since.

1. Is this how people normally feel when they are facing this sort of thing? 
2. Does talking to a therapist actually help? I'm someone who tends to be skeptical of a lot so I'm not sure what it's about or how it will help me.
3. How do you guys come to accept that your problems are legitimate? This seems to happen to me in waves where I will feel much better for a week and think to myself ""what were you even whining about in the first place?"" then sink right back down to where I am now.

When I had to go off them a few weeks ago it made me super depressed and super crazy. So maybe if I do that I’ll be able to kill myself. I hope every night I won’t wake up. I hope when I’m driving that I’ll be killed while driving. I do not want to be alive anymore

(i was turned down)

&amp;#x200B;

anyway

&amp;#x200B;

i ended up dumping my exgf because whenever i spoke to her(on the phone or in person), her mother would literally scream at me (just imagine a 8 year old breaks something worth thousands of dollars) (thats what i mean) like literally scream at the top of her lungs. The reason i broke up with her was mainly because of that and usually when her mum would scream at my exgf and she would ball her eyes out, like cry like someone died infront of her, and i could do nothing for her because she was half chinese and her mother didnt speak the best of english, but enough that i could understand most of it.

&amp;#x200B;

im now 24, every day since i dumped her i regret it, (most people say you move past it but it hasnt happened yet and i've already tried to take my life 3 times because of this) (2 of which i was in the hospital because of)(because i got luckily saved i guess)

and im starting to get a drinking problem because what i did then made me hate myself, because i lost the best moment of my life.   


the point im making is since then i never feel happy anymore since then. Like ill have very brief moments like when watching a comedy or something, but the moment its over i just go back to -120% and hate not just myself but everyone else. like some nights i will literally cry myself to sleep or just practice killing myself with the airsoft gun i have.

&amp;#x200B;

sometimes i think im a psychopath because i dont feel normal emotions anymore, but idk how true that is.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish i never made that decision, or i wish i never found love, true love in my eyes, i would have given her anypart of my body (at one point she was having heart problems and i offered her mine if it was possible (in front of her and her friends and her family)

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to move on, date other people 2 both for (2 weeks only, they dumped me because i didnt have much money), but its hard like im 24, skinny and im the main pitcher of my baseball team around 155 pounds, and in my eyes usually i try to act like people wanted to be treated.

&amp;#x200B;

i dont know should i pretend like im someone else and fake emotions? should i just end it all? should i contact my exgf who blocked me on all social media, its been more than 5 years and i know she has a bf now. should i just continue to be depressed and move on (however long that takes even if it takes more than 5 years to find someone?) and if i do that its been years since then why would things change now?    


im starting to think i wish i never knew what love was because at one point i wanted to marry that girl and father her children. like i should have given her the world and i dont know what to do.  


i've seen a couple of counsellers who werent helpful they would say stuff like, have you taken ur meds and i never missed a day, and how do u feel now? eventually they cleared me and i dont see them anymore. (the reason i dont go back to them is because i want to join the army or the police one day hopefully) and i know for a fact if i go back i will never be able to join the army even in reserves (australian army reserves) or even do non-combat work.

&amp;#x200B;

maybe i just want her back or maybe i should look for someone else? but its not easy atleast for me? or what should i do? the thing is that i dont smile anymore and very often i crymyself to sleep thinking what i did by dumping her

  
(also dont tell me because im young that my opinion is  irrelevant  because i truly loved this girl and i could feel the pain she felt in her heart when her mother  spoke to me and i would have been the father to her children)

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a lot, but I lost my step father (ran over and killed), my dad (suicide), my youngest brother (OD/suicide), my best friend (heart attack), my uncle (OD), and my beautiful wife left me and took our son [all within a 5 year span]. It's so bad now that I can't even leave my house because I feel like something horrible is going to happen and I start freaking out (I was never like this before. I was married to a beautiful woman, had an awesome son, was making over 6 figures in sales, led the state in my field, had lots of friends, a big house, and nice cars). I was living a great life in Virginia and then we moved 5 miles outside of Malibu, CA. Then the people that I closest to started dying and I went through this severe trauma &amp; now I can't even leave my bed 85% of the time. I had to move in with my mom and it's embarrassing because she basically takes care of me like I'm a child again (she grocery shops for me, she cleans the entire house, she cuts the grass, she cooks the meals, often takes care of my son when he comes over on the weekend... and I'm 37 years old).

Past memories consume my mind and suicidal ideation is my new &amp; only best friend (unless you include horrible/choppy sleep patterns, frequent nightmares, and my bed as friends). I don't drive often, but when I do drive, I have to limit my driving to about 5 miles per trip or shit can really start to hit the fan when that anxiety creeps in and I start to panic (it feels like I'm going 300 miles per hour in a go-kart with no brakes).  

People often ask me why am I having such a hard time? Why can't you work anymore? The scary thing is the fear and trauma that I feel is so overwhelming that I have to go home and lay in bed until I fall asleep so the thoughts will go away. It's a terrible thing and a hard way to live &amp; I've been in 2 psyciatric facilities (one for 72 hours the other for a month). Here's my experience in the psych facilities:  While I was in there my roommate had schizophrenia (if you did't know, you share a bedroom with at least 1 other person), and everyday he would literally tell me his name was different than the day before. One night I woke up around 2am to go pee and this dude was standing over me watching me sleep (out of pure instincts I told him he better get away from me before we have to resolve whatever it is he's thinking; I feel a little bad because I realize it's a mental illness but it's unsettling waking up to a guy standing over your bed). In group therapy he would tell the craziest stories you've ever heard in your life (stuff like his uncle made him kill his cousin when the two of them were 2 years old and it happened in a crib). When we would watch the news at night &amp; there was a story about a homicide - he would laugh uncontrollably for minutes at a time. My first name is Joe and towards the end of my stay he started to take on my identity (he basically told new people his name was Joe, and he'd tell my life stories like they were his. These were stories that I'd share in group therapy). I had to get the hell out of there before I seriously hurt this guy, but before I left they found out he has a warrant out for his arrest and the cops came and took him away (I have no idea what he did but I assume with the amount of cops that came, it wasn't a petty crime). Schizophrenia is a very scary thing when you're in a room with someone that has it &amp; you have to sleep in the room with them and all of their voices telling them to do only God knows what. The bad thing about psych facilities is they basically just baby sit you, make sure you don't kill yourself or someone else, and give you medication. It's very expensive as well.

I've also gone through approximately 280 hours of therapy (counting the time spent in the 2 psych facilities, 2 psychologists, 1 psychiatrist, and 1 therapist that I've seen). I've been on approximately 8 anti-depressants and 4 anxiety medications. I won't even get into the physical pain that I feel &amp; the headaches that I get, but something from my dad's suicide and the other loses have really messed up my mind badly and there's no shrink/therapist that I've met that can even begin to comprehend what I feel. They all basically say the same thing - Have you tried meditation and breathing techniques? You're telling me you went to college for years to only come up with the idea that breathing techniques and meditation will help with depression bad enough to not allow you to shower or brush your teeth for months, and anxiety/panic disorder bad enough to make you burst into tears, make you feel like you're choking to death, completely make you lose feeling in your face, make thoughts race faster than you can process them &amp; send you rapidly into fight or flight mode so bad that your boss has to call 9-11 to come take you to the hospital. I have a 5 year old boy to take care of &amp; raise, and I can't financially support him. I often don't feel like I'm enough because my sons mother says I never pull my weight. If I could, I would. I've tried to start 4 different careers after my dad committee suicide and I was fired from two of them within 1-4 months, and the other two I lasted less than a week &amp; I had to leave both because I had at least 3 or 4 panic attacks one hour within my shift each time (and yes I've tried meditation and breathing techniques). It's such a terrible thing to live with and if you would've asked me 10 years ago if I thought depression and anxiety were even real things - I would've said no (one of my best friends has suffered from it since childhood and I can remember telling her that it was just in her head). I guess it all is just in our heads, but the problem is nothing can make it go away (even when you go to a ton of therapy, take the medication you're prescribed, fly out to Brentwood California to see your psychiatrist and check in regularly with your general practitioner (in person and by email). I've managed to survive off of what little savings that I have and a credit card, but debt is piling up and money is running out. Waiting for a disability hearing is insanely stressful and the thought of waiting and not getting it (knowing yourself and knowing for a fact that you can't work) adds to the depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. 

I appreciate you taking the time to read this and I apologize that it's so long and I hate sounding so negative but this is how I've been feeling for almost 4 years. All I want to do is give my son the best possible life and in the process, hopefully one day I'll get better.",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,593602,public,confidence,self,Depression.

All of this has sent me down a very messed up emotional spiral and I find myself realizing the sharp tools I obtain can be used for more. Since last I have been dealing with severe back issues and anxiety coupled with my lasting depression. I find myself calling my self pathetic and worthless. All due to having to leave work because of my issues. She agreed to keep our heads up but instead has thrown us into debt even though she  makes more than enough. We do talk and when I think finally we are gonna get passed it, she does a 180 and sends me back into my bad thoughts. Maybe it's all my fault for allowing all this to happen.

Yet I thought your S/O was supposed to help you through it. Seems I've not only have been dealing but still figuring out ways to dig us out of the bull, which ends up keeping me from handling my depression. Anyone can say what they like, I've heard it all before. I just needed to vent out my frustration at being left alone constantly to my own devices all while raising 2 kids. It's getting harder to listen to my reasons, but I try. 

With all my issues I still clean and cook, do laundry, clean the yard, train our dogs, feed them too, take care of the kids and still give her sex when she wants it just to keep her happy with me.

Most of the time when I get a sickness, like a cold or the flu, I look up symptoms to see if I have it. I compare sick me to healthy me, ""oh? my leg hurts? something must be wrong with my leg"" easy enough. 

The problem for me is I don't REALLY know of I am depressed, or mentally ill at all. I can't honestly think of a time in my life when I was healthy to compare my current self to, I can't check if I feel different than other people. I can only check how I feel compared to how I used to feel.

This leads me to my next train of thought: if I am depressed, that means I don't feel happy often. I'm not sure I know what happy means. I have laughed, went out with friends, smiled at things, experienced emotions. Is that what being happy is? I honestly couldn't say. 

This leads me to believe I'm not sick, just being silly, or stupid. ""This is how everyone feels"" I tell myself, and honestly I still go back and forth on whether or not that is true.

So today I had a test in one of my classes, and statistically I did very well on it (93% correct). However, when I saw the score, I thought to myself, ""I fucking suck at this."" My parents have been constantly checking my grades, and if there's ever an assignment below an A, it's ""What did you do wrong?"" They also constantly tell me that they dont care about my grade as long as I'm trying, so then my question is why the hell do they interrogate me over a B+? Isnt that supposed to be a good grade?

In one of my other classes, the majority of my class has forgotten to turn in a (very small half-sheet) permission slip the last few days. Today, the teacher said something like, ""You guys are awful at the simplest things,"" and even though it wasn't directed at me (I had turned it in), it hurt a lot. Also, she's been a teacher for like 15 years, how does she know that isn't okay to say?

When I get home, I have to surpress all of my emotions and feelings. When I was younger, if I fell on got hurt and cried, I was constantly told ""Man up"" and ""You cant cry."" Same thing if I was ever just sad. So now anytime I start to feel sad, I get angry at myself which makes things worse. It's at the point now where now the only things I CAN feel are anger, and anxiety. Everything else is numb. And this morning, when I woke up (this isn't exaggerating), my first thought of the day was ""Why can't I just fucking die already?""

I can deal with the fact that it never happened for the first 24 years of my life, but I can’t handle the idea of going through the rest of my life as a lonely virgin.

If it just happens much later, like 30 or 40, that’s not acceptable either.

I’ll most likely locate a prostitute to lose it to long before then, but that’ll probably make me feel even worse, or maybe it will boost confidence to get laid and date like a normal human being (I’ve read that it’s worked for some guys, some even claiming to meet the love of their life right after losing it to a pro). I am way too hung up on this, I feel like even if a woman did walk into my life, I’d sabotage the relationship, just from being too worried about and focused on losing my virginity, and it’d be a real shame to lose a quality relationship just because I felt I had to lose it ASAP.

I have people telling me that I SHOULD be perfectly content with being a foreveralone virgin, and people who say “I think you’ll find someone, even while you’re still in your 20s”. My mind latches onto everything and it becomes reality in my head. I mean, there ARE guys who reach their 30s, 40s, even 50s or later who are still kissless virgins!

No offense to anyone, but I can’t bear going through that! That’s too many miserable years ahead of me to go through (I’d rather be able to take advantage of my age and get the life I want, but I’m scared it won’t work even if I really out in the effort, or scared that I’m too depressed and hopeless to put the required effort in.).

I can’t bear having so many more years to go through lonely and celibate (or just paid sex, still depressing, possibly even more than no sex at all) I just want to die right now sometimes. My mood is very fragile and easily swung, and either side hits HARD (positive or negative).

I’m not a traditional masculine man (if it’s not already obvious). I’m into women (obviously) but no desire to be a dominant partner. I really want a MDLB relationship dynamic (not necessarily playing roles 24/7 though, but I just that affection and to be nurtured, and to be sexually dominated by her, edged, teased, denied, tied up, sometimes ruined (ruined orgasm), maybe even experiment with chastity cages. Don’t get me wrong, I still want normal PIV sex, raw, bare skin to skin, but with her on top, still being the dominant partner. I may be interested in occasional “switching” though, I probably wouldn’t be into domming HER, but me getting on top and giving her a good fucking, I’d be more than happy to do that sometimes.

I need a kinky woman, maybe even kinkier and weirder than I am.

As you can see, “traditional” gender roles (dominant man/submissive woman) do not appeal to me, and I’m a soft boy.

I also don’t want kids, I can’t risk passing down my misfortune, to someone who can’t even consent to being conceived and born!

I know women like this exist, even in my age group, but my own mental state is still in my way, insecurity, depression, hopelessness, anger, stress, overwhelm (maybe a happy ending massage from a pretty Asian woman would be good for me), and feeling the future is set, out of my control.

Why am I worried about this? Because I could never get a girlfriend in high/grade school. Tons of girls called me “ugly as fuck” in school, and even more say the same thing online.

Basically, I feel like attempting self improvement is futile.

Experiencing sex and love is the one thing I REALLY desire in life. But I’m also pretty interested in trying psychedelics (those are said to change your mental state/reality for the better, even from just one trip). Besides, reality is painful, taking a trip out of my own head would be good, right? It’s pretty bad in my head.

I’ve read about some guys like me, who found their woman and enjoyed love and sex, some even older than me when they found it, so it can’t be literally impossible.

I was also thinking about trying to visit a psychic, to try out getting my future read/seen.

This is not the first time I’ve thought of this, one time when I was almost homeless (too long of a story to tell on here) I just so happened to walk by a building that was a psychic’s business! I was desperate af in that situation, the only thing that stopped me from going was that I was too broke. 

I may sound crazy, but becoming content with spending your entire life alone and celibate sounds crazy to me.

I just started community college, and get work done later than I should, because this shit consumes my mind, and end up either posting or reading about this shit, or just sitting on my bed trying to imagine how it might possibly work out.?

So basically, the fear of not truly living is preventing me from living.

It’s two in the morning right now, and I don’t even think that’ll help anymore. The nightmares are almost nightly when there’s no distraction, but lately it’s not as effective at all. 

I don’t know what to do. I made a lot of bad decisions. I’ve burned a lot of bridges. I’ve said things that I regret. I’ve lost people that I love. Squandered opportunities. I’m old enough to know that I’ve wasted so much of it flailing around. And blaming people. And being angry. And I’ve changed. Or at least, I’ve started too. But I feel like I’m too broken to keep going on like this. Every time I pick myself up, and tell myself that I can do this, I remember what I’ve done. And the people I’ve hurt. And it’s too much. 

I’ve grown so much internally, even these last few weeks. These few months. I feel like I’m a nicer person. And more forgiving. And empathetic. And I forgive those who hurt me. And I want to take responsibility. But that doesn’t stop the restless nights. That doesn’t change what I’ve lost, and those I’ve pushed away. Being a better person doesn’t make me any less lonely. It just makes me hate who I used to be even more. 

Sometimes, I wish that I could go back in time, even just a year, and do everything all over again, with all of the knowledge I have now. Sometimes I wish to put a gun to my head and make the pain go away. Sometimes in the middle of the night, when the thoughts get bad, I cradle myself and wrap my hands around my ears and eyes so that I can block anything out. I spent hours every day now, maybe twelve of them on the Internet. Playing Hearthstone. Anything to distract myself from the pain. I’m talking to myself more and more. I think I’m losing my mind, truth be told. I’m growing more introverted. It’s pretty bad now. 

And the world moves on. And your friends leave. And your family lives. And the people who you’ve wronged forget about you. But you remember. You always remember. When you’re sober and sitting in your room at two in the morning, typing this on Reddit because you have no one in the world to talk to, you remember. I wish I was at least angry. I wish that I could blame other people. I wish that I could feel anything right now other than self loathing.

Lately I’ve been so fucking low. I’m not going to say that my life is bad because I don’t feel like I’m telling the truth. Less than a week ago, the girl I love relapsed and went into rehab. God I miss her so much. I knew she was in a bad way, but I didn’t know how to help. It’s my fault she relapsed and I can’t fucking forgive myself for not trying harder. 

I’ve been a depressed piece of shit for so long that I can’t think of being any different. I tell people that I’m fine, that I’m happy. How can I expect people to care when all I do is lie to them? I’m supposed to be the upbeat good times guy but I can’t keep it up, I’m finding it harder and harder to be who I used to be.

I used to talk about my mental health issues as a joke. But it’s not funny anymore. They are killing me. I haven’t cried in so long because I’m just so numb to everything now. The only things I dream about now are Suicide and Xanax. I am nearly three months clean from benzos but I can’t stop thinking that Xanax is the only thing that will make me good. I am such a fucking hypocrite for telling her that Xanax is not the answer, that it won’t fill the void. The entire time I’m encouraging her to stay clean, I’ve been dreaming of going overboard. 

I struggle to find a reason to get out of bed, and most of the time I don’t. I’m not even sleeping because insomnia is breaking down my mind every night. The insomnia gives my depression and anxiety all the time they need to make me put a gun in my mouth. I don’t know if I want to keep living in the void, in Xanax, or not alive at all. I can only deal with so much. I can’t even recognize myself in the mirror. The dpdr and slight gender dysphoria have made it to where I can’t see myself. I don’t feel like I’m me. I don’t feel. God I just want to feel something. The hunger pains are something I guess. I’m so sorry for just ranting but I’ve got no one to vent to.

I’m a sophomore in college right now, three weeks into winter quarter. At the start of the quarter I had a relatively positive mindset, but this last week has been excruciating for me. A lot of this has to do with my roommate, but it’s less his fault and more so amplifies a greater issue I have with myself.

My roommate’s one of those people that is so naturally great at everything he does. He cooks, he gets great grades, he’s athletic, he’s charismatic, funny, incredibly talented and good looking and girls love him. And he’s also one of the most insanely intelligent and knowledgeable people I know. And it’s so fucking infuriating, because my nights have turned into a perpetual cycle of negative thoughts as to why I hate myself so much, how much I wish I was more like him (or WAS him), how I’m just a lost cause. I see none of his positive characteristics in myself. I guess people find me to be a kind person, but that’s the only possible thing I’ve ever believed about myself. I’m not very smart, I’m boring, I’m unattractive and unfunny, and i hate getting out of the dorm because of it. I can’t hardly get any matches on dating apps, and even if I do I get cowardly and unmatch a lot of the time because I think they’ll dislike me once they get to know me. It feels like everyone, including my friends, secretly thinks I’m stupid, and they’re probably right. In a lot of social situations if there’s something I’m not knowledgeable about in a group conversation I either just pretend to know what they’re talking about or shut down completely - I’ve basically been trained to think that I’m giving into my own stupidity if I ask questions and I’m so scared of appearing boring or one-dimensional. So I try to keep up with things like sports or whatever but I quickly lose interest and get exhausted quickly. I’m always so tired.

In terms of hobbies and stuff to keep myself feeling better about myself I like to play bass, though I’ve only been playing for a few months and I’m not very good at all yet. My roommate, who of course, has been playing music his whole life, decided he was gonna learn guitar at the same time I started bass, and he’s already made leaps and bounds above me comparatively. It’s like he’s using me to feel better about himself and it sucks so much. It also doesn’t help that the more I think about it the more resentful I get towards my mom, who would always act so burdened whenever I wanted to learn something new. I think it’s why I’m so scared to ask for help and feel so stupid all the time. I also run a movie/pop culture related podcast, which is probably the thing that keep me the most sane. It makes me feel like I’m actually putting out something worthwhile and I’m being productive.

Lately I've been self-reflecting and I've thought about just how long I've really been depressed. It's been almost all of my young-adult life, since I was around 16, which is 13 years.

The problem is, that it went untreated for so long because I was still high-functioning, that starting 4 years ago I began to really slip and I ended up spending a lot of money on dumb shit and sensible shit. It meant that my finances have been shaky, at best. Since quitting a somewhat well-paying job because I found it soul-sucking, I've gotten better and no longer have days where I don't get out of bed and I would even consider myself happy again, on occasions. I still struggle with having lost my identity of a person who knows their shit, to becoming an unorganised mess, but it's steadily getting better. The only problem that no one tells you about, is that your past will always come back to haunt you and remind you of your life's biggest failures. Again and again. And again.

In my case, its my finances; I've never incurred many small loans, but I somehow ended up using an old credit card for public transportation fees and now, three years later, I've found that I've racked up a debt that I didn't even know about. I can get help from my parents to take care of it, but it only makes me feel worse. That I'm almost 29 and have less control of my life than when I was a teenager. That I feel like an eternal leech. That I feel shameful for honestly having no idea I was doing this. Then I feel angry for people shaming me for my lack of foresight, because you normally don't shame people for bad choices they made while suffering through other long-term diseases. Then I feel shameful for even saying these things, for even existing, because I should and do know better, but one mistake has a linear regressional effect and it keeps stacking and adding to the heap of things just waiting for you to take responsibility of.

Some days, it feels like I have to make amends for being sick. That the world punishes me for feeling bad and that I'm doomed to feel shameful for having made bad choices, due to depression, forever. That I will never have more than a day's mental rest before I can go right back to feeling guilty for simultaneously being privileged and sick at the same time. That I should feel guilty for knowing that I'm so much better off than many in this world and yet feel so sorry for myself that I'm this sick.

Depression is just a fucking struggle, man, and no one tells you that as soon as you feel a bit okay again, you will still have to face your stupid mistakes and the shamefulness that comes from making these bad choices during your illness.",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,593629,public,confidence,self,"""Getting better"" isn't the truth.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/et8tzz/getting_better_isnt_the_truth/,no_ads,0.0

Before 3. But my mom got into some drama with my dad and stuff and took me and my brother's to b.c. y oldest brother was probably like 11(James) my second older brother was like 9(Kyle) who is mentally handicapped. She didn't tell anyone she was leaving. When we got there we lived in homeless shelter after homeless shelter. When we finally got an apartment it was infested with bedbugs. And had crackheads and prostitutes living in it. Well fast forward to the age of 7 my mom was dating a dude named Trevor. Well he started to molest me. I tried telling my mother and she said "" you just don't want me to be happy, you whore, you just want the attention."" And would hit me everytime I brought it up. So I stopped. Fast forward a year or so my mom walked in on him molesting me. Only then did she kick him out. For a year of my childhood my mother allowed her bf to molest and rape me because she thought I didn't want her to be happy. Everytime I made a noise when he was doing it he would beat the shit out of me. Now I don't know if there were other men. I remember being groomed by someone but I'm not sure if it was the same man. My memory get spotty after that. My mother would disappear for days leaving my oldest brother to take care of me and my younger, older brother. Well growing up I blocked out as much of my life as j could. I would hide in my room with books and stuff. Until my sister was born. I was 10  when she was born. her father was the only real father figure I had other than my brother. He was okay. Wanted little to do with the baby cause it was a girl. My oldest brother passed away when I was 11 and my sisters father got abusive. He took James death pretty bad. So my mother tools us and left. after a couple years she got better at being a mother, still not a good mother. Well when I hit highschool I started to make friends and my mom always would brag about how great I was at school and how she had done a bang up job. She did nothing to help raise me. She started bragging about how after being raped and molested I had still turned out great. I've tried three times to kill myself. Dropped out of school twice and barely even graduated. She knows this. So when I graduated I sat her down and told her I wanted nothing to do with her and that she is toxic. She sat on her phone the entire time and ignored me. So I moved to b.c worth my bf and blocked her on everything. I'm 21 now and I still have night terrors and panic attacks and everytime my bf and I get into a fight I start bawling. If I'm too stressed I get a foggy and then don't remember what happened for like two to three hours prior. But I am getting better with the help of my friends and myself. I try to focus on the positive. It gets really hard especially considering that my bf doesn't understand what I've gone through. He tries and cares for me unlike anyone else.

Its chinese new year now but really I cant feel happy about it at all. Our family is slowly falling apart since my grandmother passed away a few years ago and things justcstart go down hill. My mum is a bit of a control freak and just want most thing done as she wish. My dad is lay back and procrastinate to do anything, and he will show a lot of attitude when he finds my mum annoyed him. My brother is arogant and probaly look down on me and my mum, and he just think none of us understand his problem. 

We never talk about our problems and even I do, they hardly show empathy or say nice thing. T
Usually they just do not react to it at all or just throw in words like i am the one to choose that path so just suck it up.

I have problems too, I always have issues to control my temper issue and sometimes I just dont know when to stop and say something that i regret right afterwards.  

I  studied overseas for years and got back the year my grandma passed away, and I know I miss out on a lot stuff while i am away and to be honest i feel like that kinda build a wall between me and my family. I always feel like an outsider when i get back home from work. Before i notice, I start staying longer and longer at work and I just dont feel like going home.  

No matter how happy i was , I realise the closer i got near home, my mood is getting worse,fearing that will I come home to another cold war between my parents. I tried to help out on both side and it just fires back at me. We have good days sometime while everyone is happy and laugh for a while but it can just turn to a completely different situation when one of us snap. Its basically like a bomb that will explode anytime.


I dont know who to talk to and I just have trusting issue to talk about this kind of stuff to my friends. I dont know if i am depressed or not as well. I camt talk to my frds because its just hard to explain to them my situation and I am terrible at explaining stuff. And the news recently just make things worse, i dont know what i could do to help. I feel sad for all those people getting hurt and killed, when there is news saying they find died bodies of missing protestors my heart just sink. Now people are dying from the wuhan virus and people are suffering in mainland china. Doctors and nurse are overworking and trying all their best to keep things control but people running away and the authorities just want to hide the fact of how serious the situation is getting.

I've been joking tell my dad and my brother I want to die and they just laugh it off. Not like I will sctually do it but the thought of doing it just keep swirling in my mind. I dont feel happy, lost intrest in stuff that i used to like. I feel like I am living in a bubble and everything coming in is blurry and numb. Its been so long since i feel truly happy about anything. I am tired. I am exhausted . I want to scream my lungs out.

But I could not turn to anyone.

so we started hanging out more and my friends told me that we would make a really good couple and everything was fine. until a certain point (around fall) where she began to isolate herself. when i asked her what was wrong she told me it’s just her “depressive behavior” and it’s nothing i can do about. but further on i noticed that she really isn’t in the right place for a relationship. that’s when i told her “hey, i see this isn’t working, i’m really sorry but lets just stay friends” and she seemed pretty fine about it. 
so for three weeks no one heard anything from her and i kinda went on with my life and everything was fine (kinda). 
then after three weeks of complete silence she started messaging our group chat and asked wether she could join us at a house party my friend hosted for us. everyone asked me first if i was okay about it. and i was, i mean i can’t forbid her anything. 
then at the party i had a little breakdown since this is what happens to me when i drink to much . so i just talked to my best friend outside on the front porch. eventually the girl came out and noticed that something was wrong with me. she asked my friend what’s going on and he just told her that i’m not doing well and well leave soon. so he went inside to collect our stuff. while i was sitting outside, the girl stayed with me and tried to cheer me up. when me and my best friend left she joined us since it was getting late and she lived nearby my house so she wouldn’t walk alone. 
after i arived home she messaged me and confessed her love she still had for me and told me she was behaving like an idiot prior. so we started dating again and everything was fine beside some days where she went on mute again. but i didn’t bother. 
a few weeks later i finally found out why she sometimes isolated herself from me. the reason was “i’m kind of afraid of relationships because my former  relationships would always break apart only after a few months but you really mean something to me and i don’t wanna loose you” 
like okay now we know what the problem is, now we can maybe fix this as a couple. so a few days we decided to make it “official”. i could see she was supper hyped and happy about it and i heard from her sister that she already waited when would i finally ask her wether we’re a couple or just dating. (keep this in mind)
the day after we were officially a “couple” she ignored me completely. no texts, no snaps, no nothing. just complete silence. i thought it would be her “isolation days” so i just waited a bit and eventually asked her out again. but she told me she would already meet a friend of hers and she doesn’t have time that day. so i just chill for a few day’s but already ask myself “you’re to depressed to meet your boyfriend for a week but go out with your friends, but ok maybe it’s some girls night whatever thing”. so after i wait again a few days anxiously since i’m an over thinker :D
still nothing, as if she doesn’t know who i am. and then i see a story of a friend how she and nearly everyone of my friends are outside and no one even bothered to ask me wether i want to join them. 
so i text her “what’s wrong” and i get no answer for two days. eventually i text her, since she wouldn’t answer my phone calls “is this over” and she replies with “yes, i’m sorry i just can’t handle a relationship right now” 
so i’m sitting here and asking myself “you were waiting for me to make it official, even tho you knew you don’t want a relationship right now and don’t even have the guts to breakup with me, since i didn’t want a breakup”  well alright my confidence and trust in humans dropped once again to 0 since i got played a lot by girls in my past. 
but now to top everything, all my friends kinda dropped me, since it’s like the third time that they went out with the girl to watch a movie, to get a drink and so on. i still have my best friend but even he kinda started to distance himself from me and is hanging out more often with me “ex girlfriend”. 
and now i even see how she and another good friend i’ve known for 6 years upload matching pictures on instagram and just behave like a couple and just have fun. 
i can’t forbid them to see each other but it’s just a big ass FUCK YOU when your friend starts to act like best friends with your “ex girlfriend” which broke up with you only three days ago. 
so yea, now i’m completely lonely and by lonely i mean lonely. everyone kinda dropped me and i don’t even know why. 
i don’t know whether someone’s going to read this but i just needed to tell this to “someone”

I started seeking therapy from September last year and do it like 2 or 3 times a month at least. My therapist is amazing!

She is a bit unconventional this way where she uses a more human and connected approach instead of the cold , pad scribbling , over logical shrink which is the norm. 

But the problem is, I feel it’s taking too long. I want to deal with emotional baggage along with present problems but I am not able to do it properly or rather not able to do it quickly enough. 

I also feel stigmatised and weak for taking therapy because of past hangups I guess. Plus I am realising a lot of things affecting my life are not in my control anyways and I keep feeling suicidal or neglect my health anyways.

I remember thinking how wonderful that was, and so every night I would pray.  
I prayed for my parents,  that they would always love 
me and take care of me. 
I prayed for peace in the world,  BC even thru my child's eyes I could see that there was far too much war.  
I prayed for strangers,  people who I never met,  but it was told to me by others that they were in a bad way, and so I would pray,  and ask the father God to help them. 
I prayed for riches,  because there were so many things that I saw would be better with more money.  I saw that my father would laugh more,  that my mother wouldn't be stressed out so much.
I prayed that I could be a better child,  so my father wouldn't scream at me so much,  and maybe my mother would stop hitting me 
I prayed for my older sister,  who seemed so much younger than me at the time, that she would find more strength,  and that my mother would stop saying mean things to her, and stop slapping her to the point of breaking her glasses.  
As I grew older,  I prayed for protection from my parents,  because with every day that passed, they grew more bitter, more hateful, quicker to discipline and less inclined to give hugs and kisses.  
I prayed for forgiveness for the hatred I felt in my heart for my parents when they hit us, or called us names, she whore, and me nymphomaniac.  
I prayed for a knight on a white horse to come take me out of the hell that was my childhood home,  because I was too scared of the outside world to leave on my own.  
I prayed for patience,  that I wouldn't snap one night and kill my parents in their sleep,  not out of hatred,  but out of silent fear and desperation.  
But then one day, my fear turned to hatred, my prayers to screams. 
I screamed at the so called ""benevolent God"", because as much as people talked about and to him,  he had no time or love for me. 
I cried for the child I never was,  for the little girl that to this day flinches should someone try and touch her face,
I hated my parents for the birthright of pure and undiluted bitterness they gave me, and I cursed them for their rejection as they turned away from the monster that they had made me.
I raged at the injustice of life,  that my youth had been carved out of hopelessness, and my future blinded my pure despondency. 
I wept as I took a blade to my veins in a night where all who claimed to love me had abandoned me, and as i bled and wept, no one but the shadows were there to console me.  In a night where I should have died, the only thing that died was that myth of a loving god.
From the blood and shadows of my insanity, there rose a different type of gods, those gods of the madmen, and the goddesses of the outcasts, and it was them and only them who answered my prayers and lead me back to the road of the living. 
I'm a mother now, and once again my prayers have changed. I no longer pray for world peace, BC I've seen the condition of man and know that as long as we are here there can never be peace entirely.  Instead I pray for just enough peace that I can sleep throughout the night, and not lay awake with my heart pounding in fear.
I pray for the strength to forgive my parents,  and the determination not to allow their bitterness to infect the root of my soul,
I no longer pray for strangers,  but for my children and my soulmate who protects me,  that they will forever be safe and wrapped in my love. 
I no longer pray for riches,  as I have seen how riches corrupt the soul,and greed is never truly fulfilled.  I only pray for what I myself can gain by my own hands and honest work,  that I can give my babies the happiness that I was denied.  
I pray for different things now,  but things that others take for granted:  that I can feel happy and safe,  that I can experience the unconditional love of a soulmate, and that I can feel comfortable just being me.  When people asked me why I no longer pray to their God,  I answer them in the same words with which I pray, and the end is always the same.... they turn away, horrified, confused because they cannot understand the voice of my manhood heart and broken soul.  Neither can their God.  But those gods and goddesses who came to me from the shadows,  who walked with me through hell, who taught me their language in  strange lullabies of comfort, they have always understood, and they answered,  because who can understand the insanity of a dark world, but an insane God,  and who can know the broken heart of a lunatic woman, but a mad goddess",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,593649,public,confidence,self,The prayer of a madwoman,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/et9hux/the_prayer_of_a_madwoman/,no_ads,0.0

But hell, I've been struggling with depression for fucking years and I feel like I'd be sad and regret it if I didn't share. It's a little bit of strange advice and a small success story. 

TL;DR: If video games used to be something you enjoy, and you've made yourself stop playing them because they're childish or whatever the fuck. Play one. Play a classic you've seen recommended a ton of times. 

Used to have a bit of problem with video games (what am I kidding still do) where I binge play them and they consume my life until I finish them. Went through some weird phase where I believed that social media, video games and TV shows were fake happiness and escapism, not real like the satisfaction you get from working hard. I decided to download this action, open world RPG game because I was feeling so defeated about other life events I was like fuck it, what does it matter, my productivity is messed anyway and I don't care. 

Binge played it for a couple weeks and I don't know man I literally cried tears of joy. It was like a combination of Skyrim, Star wars: KOTOR and fallout. Some games I used to really enjoy. I had fun. I can't even tell you the last time I felt like I was having fun. It doesn't even stop there, since finishing it life feels more rewarding, I dare say I'm almost enjoying it. It's shook up a real storm with my internal reward system. I feel so much better, I feel a little bit like my old self again. 

I used to also have problems with smoking weed every single day. But I smoked some weed and played this game. It was amazing. I remember setting up team tactics for the first time because I played on a harder difficulty. Made each of my characters protect each other in this weird order where someone was backing someone else up while being backed up by another one. This stupid AI I was supposed to protect did the dumbest shit possible. It took me by surprise, I was raging and laughing at the same time, it was so immersive. Didn't feel like fAkE haPpIneSS at all, if anything I've learnt I can be a pretentious twat and I need to let go a little.

Now this is going to sound crazy... But I'm actually feeling sharper. I'm reading more, I'm thinking. My god, my productivity before and after this game. What was I even thinking. A little bit of that depression 'fog' always slowing me down has cleared up. So I googled it and lo and behold, whether it's related or not.

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29483888](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29483888) 

This all sounds so insane. I can't tell you it was specifically the video game because maybe it had to do with challenging my own preconceived views. I'm honestly surprised I enjoyed it so much, I don't usually feel anything even when doing activities I used to engage in. Who knows what the fuck it was. 

Sorry if this post isn't appropriate, or it's dumb advice. I swear it came with good intentions if nothing else. I'm just saying, if you're treatment resistant like me (been in therapy and tried a whole bunch of medications). Why not? What's the worst that can happen? It's a fucking video game, it's not like I'm cured.

I have social anxiety and no friends because of isolation since 12 years old, low self-esteem, and mental disorders that haven't got diagnosed yet — because I'm too broke to even go to the clinic and get checked. Addicted to nicotine and caffeine. Again, I feel like something is seriously wrong with me — and whatever it is, it got worse and makes me freezes in sadness and makes me suicidal.

Full story, my parents marriage didn't work out, but they're still together despite great economy struggles. This is important because my parents clashed in their way raising their children; my father is strict and disciplined, but he's too busy working so we can eat. My mum on the other hand, only cooks and clean the house, she don't even care about the future and educations of her children.

Ever since leaving school because my father can't afford it in 2007, my brothers and I have been growing up as it is. We study only when we feel like it, sleep and woke up late. We manage to get education even though, me personally, are 5 years late.

I'm already in University where I can study at home, but it's damn difficult because I was not disciplined. I think I failed the first term, I start to rethink why I pick the business major when I have no interest in it, but I'm too anxious to tell my father that I want to change major because that means the money is wasted. I'm anxious for the test results that'll come out in February.

My breaking point is in December last year when it's the final exam. I have a break down and became suicidal, my mental state hasn't got any better. For a long time, I have been trying to be disciplined, starting over and over and over again but always failed. I have been writing a journal since 2016, and there's no major improvement at all — in fact I got worse ; I woke up at 1.30 p.m. today because I can't sleep until 6 a.m., I haven't done anything productive, just mindlessly watching YT videos and writing some shitty fan fiction. My father has long given up on me.

My father said his work partner, our only source of income for years, will close their business I think in the beginning of June. My brothers and I are in our 20s, none of us was ever employed or working. I'm pretty sure my brothers also have depression seeing their behaviour, so I can't really depend on them.

But I don't want this to continue. I planned to get my mental health checked this month, but my sadness pushes me to buy cigarettes instead. Though that's not the only problem. I'm too scared that once I do go, my father will questions me and will talk me back on not going to the therapist like back in December, and I'm just simply not ready to share my thoughts because we're not that close. Maybe he thought I'm just lacking discipline and simply lazy, I don't think that's the case.

I have done some research, I think I might have the inattentive type of ADHD and it has been the massive hinder in my life that always makes me fail. I'm interested in so many things, but I feel like I don't know how to start finding out or working on them. I used to think I liked to read, but I have pile of books I bought that I never read since years ago. But when I'm doing something, even studying, I'll forget to eat and study for hours — but it only happens once or twice a month. All the small responsibilities that seems easy always overwhelms me.

I'm not sure anymore just how much wrong is happen in my life and how much it drives me to insanity, because no normal person would fail for years at the simplest things like sleeping or waking up early, or even doing small things they're supposed to do like making their bed after waking up. It's so damn hard to just wake myself up, but I don't want to give up...

Being tired all day but not sleeping at night 

My emotions being so low, and the next moment they take flight 

When something isn’t working and it feels like a personal attack
When something so small can set me so far back 
When there are days when my will to live is 
sick, withered, and black 

The guilt I feel for burdening people’s lives with the flaws of my personality 

Coping with it by laughing at it casually 

Not wanting to pick up phone calls, listen to voicemails, or answer texts 
Not wanting to do anything cause sometimes I just wished I were dead 

There. Even when my life is filled with laughter, love, and everything I could want. (I swear it has nothing to do with you, mom.) 

The guilt, again, because “What’s there to be depressed about? You have a good family and a warm house.” 

In my head, my heart, I feel it in my body.  

Killing me from the inside, I can feel myself rotting. 

The most beautiful minds are capable of the ugliest thoughts. 

Even if I lose this fight, aleast I could say I fought.

I'm a substitute teacher and today I got really down about the fact that class was supposed to start and the door to my class assignment still wasn't unlocked. That pretty much sent me down low again and I'm back to feeling how I almost always feel. 

What I realize, though, is that it's not the minor inconvenience that sends me back into feeling like crap, it's the fact that those things stop me from running away from my anxieties and making me face them, which brings on the depression. 

Whatever minor thing that forces me to stop and think, makes all the things I've been running from catch up to me.

I made some mistakes and bad choices but when I needed them most, they said I was fucking up and blocked me on all social media and never talked to me again. Around the same time, I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years due to both of us emotionally abusing each other. It was for the best, but it was hard to let go. I became best friends with a guy and he’s now my boyfriend. My best friends did not like my new boyfriend, along with the bad choices I was making, and now treat me like I never existed. 


A month and more later (2018) I feel so empty. I have no friends besides my boyfriend and my cat. I can talk about anything to him but he’s not a “girl” friend. I can’t really talk about makeup and girl stuff. I can’t really have a girls night out or hang out with anyone other than my boyfriend. I am all alone.


1 year later (2019), my best friend (Stuart) in the world that I have been with since I was 6, that I grew up with together, got really ill. He had to be put down the day before his 18th bday, which is 2 days before my 24th bday. I know he’s just a cat but he was everything to me. He would comfort me during hard times and made me feel joy during good times. My world was already dark, but when he passed, my world became black and collapsed, making me feel the weight of sorrow, loneliness, and emptiness. My baby gave me a reason to keep going in life and gave me love and happiness, even if I didn’t have anyone to talk to. Now, it’s gone. The flame of a candle blew out.


2 years later (2020), I am still with my boyfriend  and I am ready for a new cat in my life. The emptiness and sadness I feel since my cat’s passing a year ago is still strong. I would love to go to the shelter and adopt a cat or a kitten but my parents have said no multiple times. I wish they knew how empty I feel. No matter what I do or who I’m with, the emptiness that developed after my baby’s passing is still there. I want to have a reason to keep going, do better, and love myself again. My boyfriend gives me that, but not as much as my cat, who never judged and loved me unconditionally no matter what. It’s so hard for me.


I lost my 2 best girl friends and I then lost my best friend in the world, my kitty. I know it’s been 2 years since I’ve talked to the girls and 1 year since my cat passed, but I feel so much pain as if it happened a week ago. I miss them so much. Even after 2 years, I still haven’t made new friends, well, not like them, and I don’t have another cat. When I don’t have anything to do, I sleep. I stay in my room and isolate myself because I don’t think I’m worth the struggle to try to live or get better anymore. I feel like I’m a burden to other people and no one wants me around.

So I do not suffer from depression so I have no idea how to really go about this. 

So my boyfriend and I have been dating for around 5 months now, and he told me in the beginning that he does get depressed (also we live in New Hampshire where it’s effing cold in January). 

So yesterday my boyfriend told me that he was starting to “lose interest” in me, and has loss interest in other things and he had no idea why he was. Not to get to TMI he told me that his sex drive is not even there as well, he can’t even get it up for himself to get off on his own, and trust me I know how sexual this guy is. He says that he is physically and mentally exhausted. He has also been sick as well this week. You know I asked him he he wanted to break up and his answer was no, and asked if he wanted to be with me and his answer was yes. (So I am leaving it at that).

As of recently he has done a shift change at work.. he went from working from 3:15pm -11:45pm and would be going to bed at like 4am from video games lol. Now he just started a new shift last week and is now working from 6:45AM-3:15pm. Now I can understand the physical exhaustion from dramatically going from going to bed at 4am routinely to now waking up at 5:30am. He says that he just looks forward to the weekends here he can just relax, and granted we are hanging out this weekend and going out. 


May I mind you the text messages are a little short compared to what we have been. His confidence seems to be a bit low, always asking if I’m okay. He still says the “I love you and love you”.


So what I am asking: “is this a sign of depression if so what can I do to help him?” Or if anyone can really just give me any sort of advice.

I’m a girl who’s currently a senior in high school and have been going through a lot lately. I think I’m a good, smart student - straight As, headed to an Ivy League next year, dedicated member of drama club, and wonderful caring friends that I love more than anything. 

Without giving up too information, my home life is rough - physical and emotional abuse, law suits, an affair, a parent leaving for months and then returning, etc. I’m usually a very resilient person when bad things have happened in the past, but over the last couple weeks I’ve felt really stuck and one of my teachers noticed. I’m usually very loud and bubbly and smiley and energetic, but recently I’ve been quiet and in my own little world. I feel like I’m going through the motions of my day without any meaning behind it; like I’m a spectator to my life without really being in it. My teacher approached me on the very first day that my behavior changed and she asked if I was ok quietly during a class. I quickly responded I was. 

A week later, she again told me she misses me being goofy and that she misses me smiling. Again, quietly in a room full of chattering kids. My reflexes caused me to blurt out, “Sorry, I’m ok.” 

I was in guidance today for a scheduling issue when my counselor told me my teacher voiced her concerns to him. I realized that my teacher wasn’t asking if I’m ok out of obligation to- she genuinely cares. I feel like I just want to talk to her and tell her what’s going on because I feel bad that I’m causing her to worry. But, when she brings things up to me, it’s in a classroom with other kids. I feel incredibly awkward asking her to talk privately. Even if I do, how do I start the conversation? What do I even say?

And I believe all these events lead me to develop a personality disorder as well as depression. To preface, I am a female.

When I was in grade 3, a teacher made fun of me, embarrassed me, ignored my academic questions, and reprimanded me in front of the entire class for almost the whole school year just because my mom told an acquaintance (who was also a teacher at my school) that she didn’t give enough homework (lol Asian parents). I guess that info somehow got back to my teacher and she started targeting me. This lead me to never question a teacher again. I’m still afraid of asking questions in class (I’m in college already), I really try to fade into the background as much as possible.

When I went on to high school, yet another teacher made my self-esteem plummet. For the entire first year he was in charge of my class, he couldn’t (for the life of him) remember my name when he wanted to call me to answer a question. He would be like “Ummm Helpful-Fa... Ahh I can’t remember” and the class would burst out laughing... I was always so embarrassed when he did that because I was the ONLY student who he couldn’t remember. LITERALLY, he could remember everyone’s name except mine, even the difficult to pronounce ethnic names... When I started developing acne around that time, he coincidentally started to remember my name. I guess my acne suddenly made me more memorable... The guys in my class also suddenly paid less attention to me when my acne came and I honestly just started hating guys for how shallow they were from then on (I don’t mean to throw all guys under the bus but my experience has lead me to develop a phobia of guys).

There are more incidents but I don’t really feel like opening up that can of worms right now. I have trouble (ha that’s an understatement) opening up to people, avoid social events at all cost, hide in my dorm all day (I even bring food from home so that I wouldn’t have to interact with cashiers to buy my meals). I’m afraid to invite more people into my life and I cry when I’m reminded of how pathetic I am. I have been thinking about suicide since I was 17 and I’m currently 20 but I’m too much of a coward to go through with it. I honestly wish my mom had aborted me when she found out she was pregnant with me at 42 (I was an unwanted pregnancy). It has come to a point where I am resenting my parents for bringing me into this unforgiving world. My siblings are mentally healthy while I’m such a nutcase. No one in my family understands why I am the way I am but I don’t blame them. It wouldn’t be fair for mentally healthy people to understand how it is like having a personality disorder AND depression.
I know there are a lot of people whose predicament is much worse than mine but I just had to rant to release the pent up emotions I’ve been feeling.

Everything started to go downhill at age 15 I think. That's what I pinpoint as the ball beginning to roll. My sister, 16 at the time, revealed to my mum that she had been having regular suicidal thoughts, and had tried, and thankfully failed, to take her own life. After a doctors checkup and few therapy sessions, she was diagnosed with severe depression, anorexia, and hyperactive episodes. This hit me hard. I felt, and still feel, responsible for the deterioration of her health. If I just asked and listened, maybe everything would've been ok. In some ironic way, her journey into getting better, and my journey into depression had both began.



A year later, high school came to a close (June 2018). I was bullied due to my awkwardness and appearance , which damaged my self esteem hard. I left high school with the sole idea of spending time with friends and relaxing. I did the opposite, spending no time outside the confines of my bedroom, slowly convincing myself that I was unloved and unwanted. This is where things get worse.



In May 2018 (backwards in time I know, but please stick with me), my parents announced their divorce. Not unexpected, and I was almost happy for them,as their relationship had deteriorated due to stresses with my sister and my dads frequent drinking habits. In July 2018, me, my mother and sister moved to my nans for a whole 10 months. In that time my obsession with reality began. My view on reality became warped. I believed I was no one, incapable of love or loving myself, and saw myself as worthless and pathetic. I would dream of scenarios where I would become a hero to save the world, or go on an epic quest. I saw every little thing as a sign that I had been chosen, often retreating to my room, spending hours alone doing nothing but imagining pretend scenarios in darkness. I became obsessed, and soon, I started to contemplate suicide.




Why was I alive if not for a reason? Where was my epic quest? My reason to live? I was so pathetic, why was I still alive? I lay in bed, some days I would cry but that stopped. It would just be silence and emptiness. This carried on into college, until February 2019, and with my first serious girlfriend, let's call her Tat.



Tat was, no word of a lie, the driving factor of improving myself. I became less obsessed, and put all my attention into talking and listening to everything she said and did. She was beautiful, smart, passionate, everything I wanted. But I soon went back into old habits. I mistreated her trust, having regular panic attacks about who I was and why I was here, and ended the relationship 3 times before getting back with her. I was awful. 



Through Tat, I began therapy, which didnt help at all. I put no time into improving myself and instead binge ate and watched anime, slowly starting to feel nothing towards the things I loved. I began to obsess with fictional characters, having fake conversations with characters like Handsome Jack about my choices in life, and how I should pick myself up. It sounds motivating, but it just dug me deeper into self loathing and emptiness.



Tat tried to help, letting me confide in her, but my lifestyle and attitude began to push her away. Knowing the symptoms and what had happened before she suggested we end the relationship just 2 weeks ago, to which I agreed. I didnt want to, but I had become a happiness vacuum, and I wanted her to be happy again. I would message her, knowing it wont reach her, about how I hope shes okay and that I'm sorry. I have only recently stopped this, theres no point to it.



Which leads us to now. I am the lowest I have ever been. I have contributed nothing to my family, my friends have made me the butt of most jokes, constantly telling me In extremely unfunny for ""banter"", and the girl I'm madly in love with has removed me off all social media and wont even look at me. I have fell back into habits of overeating and obsessing over monologing in a vain attempt to shit out a sentence that might help me. I feel worthless, pathetic and unlovable, and have ceased all work in my college course, opting to do nothing. Cause that's all I feel. Nothing. I cry and then I dont, because what's the point? I wont kill myself, I'm too much of a pussy, so I let myself suffer. I have no reason to be here. Even now when I type this I feel nothing, what the fuck is wrong with me? I'm just done. I'll live my life, but God if I could just end it  without anyone getting upset Id take that in a heartbeat. I dint even feel deserving enough to be sad or depressed, I keep telling myself I'm just lying. Maybe it's a coping mechanism to cover the actual truth of I'm just so fucking alone and scared and I want it to end. I dont know.

Anyway, it's pretty much what it says on the title. Also, apologies in advance for any mistakes (spelling, butchering the language, etc) and for being all over the place/probably not providing more context.

It's been three years since what I thought was my best — my 'okayest', if we're honest — life fell apart. My girlfriend left me, I made a terrible mistake and quit my medication, I found myself broke as hell, still stuck with my parents in this piece of shit town in this shitty third world country, and my friends left in the pursuit of better lives, pretty much all of them achieving their goals in some form.

There were some okay things in the past. I worked not-so odd jobs, I traveled a bit, I believed I enjoyed some moments with friends and on my own, and all of that meant shit, because I haven't been able to move the fuck on and do something with my life. For fucks sake, I spent a decade believing, trying, attempting, to be a musician, but fear (disguised as procrastination) helped me fuck it all up. I have probably picked up a guitar or played keys four times in the past two years. I dropped out of college twice because I was only going in order to please my parents — some things were interesting but not enough for me to stay —  and I'd pretty much spend all day locked in the restroom shitting my pants from sheer panic. I lost so much weight people think I'm dying. I mean, I wish I was. I tried hopping back on my meds, but it turns out that there are massive shortages of antidepressants so that is out of the question. I would ask for help but I'm the type of person that helps everyone, but won't get help when he needs it, so I'd rather not.

Despite everything being completely bad, I kept trying to stay afloat. For a while, I worked as a translator and transcriber. Started out as a freelancer and eventually got into this agency that treated me like a slave and well, I got burnt out on that. Sometimes I wanna go back to freelancing but I haven't had stable internet access in months so that's out of the question. I've been thinking about applying to a bunch of institutes or something, maybe teach some English, but I don't think I'm suitable for the job... There's always someone better than me, anyway. 

I feel so insanely ugly and like a giant fraud and I know there's people worse than me, but they're doing so much better while I'm here just not wanting to be here or be me at all. I don't even know what I want, and when I think I want something, something tells me I'm lying to myself. I tried going back to therapy, but this time it was just miserable. This therapist wasn't even trying. She was just assuming I'm some kid from a wealthy family and wouldn't hear me out, she just wanted to get paid. If I were from a wealthy family I wouldn't be here, goddammit. I could barely afford those sessions anyway.

God, I fucking hate myself so much. Who or what I've become. Every year just gets worse. I'm gonna turn 30 this year and I haven't felt like I've done something important for myself and it's very likely I won't. I want to die but ironically, I'm afraid of dying. Especially a slow, painful death. I've been trapped in this place mentally and emotionally for so long that I don't think I'm good at anything. Any talents I could have had or could have developed have been long lost. I'm never gonna get out of here. I'm never gonna be okay, and I'm never gonna live whatever life I probably deserve or don't.",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,592953,public,confidence,self,"Not only do I feel like I'm the biggest worthless/useless dumbass in the world, I am truly afraid to live or die.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/esjt65/not_only_do_i_feel_like_im_the_biggest/,no_ads,0.0

I started an celexa 20mg on Jan 2nd for depression/anxiety. I have taken celexa previously, and it worked well. I ended up taking myself off of it without consulting my doctor which did not end up well.

When I quit taking celexa I engaged in very risky behavior and used a lot of recreational drugs (mainly psychedelics).

I have been on celexa for almost a month now, and I find it isn't working how it did the first time I took it. I'm wondering if I need to give it a little more time, or, if through all of my psychedelic use I altered my brain chemistry to the point where this AD no longer works for me.

Does anyone have experience using psychedelics or other recreational drugs that can offer advice on starting/finding the right medication, or any advice in general?

They said I was talking about my looks ALL the time  which isn't true at all. I got banned because We were talking about dogs and which dog fits the person.

I've been bullied my entire school life, called ugly, ugly ape, you will never get a girlfriend, nobody likes you, look at those clothes that you are wearing did your mom pick them out for you. That's only the mental abuse there was also the fighting which I hated even more. I tried to ignore them but that didn't work and then there is the annoying abuse of tapping my head in class and stuff like that making paper airplanes throwing them at me, saying my name in class, so I would look at them and get something hurt full said to me. Only thing that worked was finishing school, meanwhile I was getting bullied my dad was getting sicker and sicker and that also had a big toll on me and made me even more depressed. I started with setraline and then went over to lexapro 20mg. After graduating from High school, I was abusing amphetamines a lot. I also have ADD and have been diagnosed with it only A couple of weeks ago, finally ( I only get Wellbutrin right now but when things like side effects are manageable which they are I don't have any  I get Ritalin as well).  So I was abusing that ugly filthy drug all the time, I didn't know what to do with my life after high school, so I went to this school for Concept Art I thought that would be cool and I could do that. We'll I was on amphetamines so it seemed like I could do anything really, so fucking dumb.

 What happened there my parents wouldn't even believe at first. The teachers there didn't give a fuck.

I had a girl next to me drawing my face every day in beautiful detail at the angle she was sitting next to me, and she showed it to me when she knew I figured everything out that was happening, I heard whispers of a conversation I had with this girl I met on tinder coming from the seats in front of me. I was freeking out I thought I had psychosis and I had to be hospitalized. Well I wasn't and I was… I was having acute psychosis because of the amphetamine abuse and not sleeping because of the girl I met on tinder she was keeping me up at night, I couldn't believe how much energy she had to keep on talking till 6am the next morning while she also went to school, so I talked with her everyday till 6 and got up for school took another dose and there I went. A lot of girls in my class were sick all of a sudden than this girl was ""sick"" than this other girl was ""sick"", very strange. Turns out they were catfishing me with one account taking turns, ALL OF THEM..I was one of the three boys in the class and the mastermind of the girls choose me because maybe (?!) I was the cutest I guess? One girl from another class even called me as the girl from tinder, so I was sure she wasn't an old guy cat fishing me. I went mental. I cried for weeks, I stopped using amphetamines and slept for days (the psychosis went away) and my self-confidence was zero or maybe even beneath zero. The bullying all my life now this..it made me a mess. So there is no ego to speak off. Nobody notices this or could see this if they just saw my face. But it happened. And It sucked. I felt used and filthy. I felt so lonely and the girl on tinder made me feel loved again…I wanted that feeling of love so badly...I got pain in return.

It has been 3 years since this happened but I still don't have friends, still depressed, I even tried to kill myself and OD'd on fentanyl which didn't work they saved my life and I'm so grateful they did…my poor mom if I think about her and the situation that happened I can do one thing and that's cry.  
I also don't understand how you can generalise people like me? Because I'm not that typical lonely looking guy I don't belong in a group about being lonely because I don't LOOK lonely..WTF? I hope nobody thinks this way. Mabye its a powertrip I don't know. I don't even want to think about it anymore. People like that always think I tell my story for attention but I tell my story for people to help me and understand what I've been thru and listen to you guys story. I love listening. I love helping people. I love loving people. I am so glad that I didn't die that night. On the first of january of all days. I'm so glad.  


Do you guys have any good chatroom I can go to btw? Thanks a lot for reading all this.

For about 6 months now I have been holding back my emotions, I keep telling myself ""I'm not depressed, I'm just feeling a little sad, that's all"" and I hate this mentality I set up in my brain, I don't want to go to therapy, because I'm convinced I'm not depressed, but my parents are genuinely worried, my parents are my best friends (I may seem like a loser, but my parents are really understanding and cool) they keep saying I never go outside and that I don't have alot of interaction,and it's true, I don't talk to people irl but for a long time, not even online, up until now ofc. But, I feel happy in my own imaginary world, I make up and draw friends, and they are better then anything else in the world, my parents are still worried. I understand them, but it's just how I am. I looked through many articles and videos that explained depression, and I do fall under most of them. But no, I don't want to be depressed, everyone in my class says they are depressed, they laugh and smile, hold their iPhones and expensive clothes, but still say how they are depressed over a bad grade they got, I refuse to be depressed because of those people, I don't want to have a thing in common with them. Depression has become a norm in this school, and it's just so sad, because I fear that people who genuinely feel hopeless and worthless will not get help from the teachers, Because they heard it all.

I feel very tired. Recently got an offer from Oxford university but I feel nothing but vague dread about what the future holds. Doubt I'll get in anymore anyways, at the moment I barely show up to lessons, nevermind do any work. I have enormous mood swings in short periods of time, I've been trying to take some notes on how I'm feeling since I struggle to remember what my mood has been like recently and during the rest of my life. Honestly I find it hard to tell if my notes are even telling the truth. I really feel disgusted at the way I look and who I am, e.g. cried yesterday after I caught myself in the mirror getting out the shower. The inner narrator in my head (the real me?) is a horrible, desperate and pathetic and sometimes I can't get these thoughts to shut up when I want to. I'm very lonely but not capable of friendships and socialising, though I generally get along ok with other people. I really don't have anything to say to people and keeping up talking is tiring, I do speak to some people online but I've been behaving irratically and I think I'm making them not like me/find me annoying. The GP might think nothing wrong with me and im being melodramatic, but either way I need to know. 

I'm awful socially and really find it hard in new situations like this, I'd be hugely grateful if anyone could answer these questions for me, no detail is too obvious

1. **What exactly do I need to say when I phone to book an appointment at the GP?** 
2. **What will the conversation with the GP sound like? Will they ask me what they need to know or do I need to prepare what I am going to say?**

I've had low self esteem and depression for as long as I can be remember. About a week after I graduated high school, I was sexually assaulted by a friend. For months after that, he sent me hateful messages through social media and made fun of my body constantly. When I started college, he was still messaging me and my depression was at its lowest point. I was suicidal and completely alone. The first friend I made was a guy who wanted to date me. I told him no many times because I wasn't interested in starting a relationship, but he was really sweet and caring so I eventually gave in.  After a few months of dating, I still felt like I wasn't in the right emotional place for a relationship, but he managed to talk me out of breaking up with him (I'm a huge pushover as you'll see). A few months later, I went to my hometown and hung out with an old friend and he asked me if I was doing okay because he was worried about me. I told him everything and he really helped think everything through; I still didn't feel ready for commitment. When I came back, I tried breaking up with my boyfriend again. He accused me of cheating on him with my friend from home and I felt so guilty (even though my friend from home had no interest in me) that I ended up giving in once more. The next time I tried, he got really emotional and told me that if I broke up with him, that he wouldn't have anything to do with me anymore. Being completely depressed and alone, I didn't want to take that risk. Meanwhile, I still had no idea what I wanted to do with me life and tried to find something to major in. Eventually, I met his family and friends and it felt more and more difficult to pull away even though I didn't have any feelings for him. I just felt like I was sinking deeper and deeper and felt like it was going to be impossible to ever leave him. He was a very sweet guy and he loved me more than anything, but I just never felt the same way. I didn't need a boyfriend- I needed to deal with my emotional health and focus on my future career. I tried breaking up with him a few more times after that. He proposed to me my junior year and I felt too guilty to say no. I was suicidal and I thought that I couldn't function on my own; all of my friends were his friends. He was a great person and I just couldn't hurt him...he would just talk me out of it anyway. I've always dreamed of being on my own and figuring things out for myself. We graduated college and got married a month after. I still had no idea what I wanted to do with my life after countless internships and jobs. We've married been 5 years and even though he is an incredible person, I just don't have any feelings for him. I regret staying with him, but I just hold in the guilt and pretend that I'm happy.

I'm not the only one.

This trend isn't new either. This has happened before.

It will likely happen again.

I lay, motionless on the sofa for the nth day running, staring at a TV on mute, thinking about everything from how I got here, to how I get out, to how German finance in the latter part of the 17th century influenced a series of events that led to the First World War. Yeah, it's not always worry that occupies your mind, sometimes it's just any old nonsense. And then I made a phone call.

The first 'other person' I'd cared to hear from since October.

They told me to get help. They told me to aggressively pursue it. The way I always have in the past, but this time with a professional team rather than the rag tag bunch. This time it was serious. This time it wasn't about attention.

So I did. I threw the last of my weed in the bin and waited for the ambulance to arrive. They took me to MIND in Shrewsbury, because no other facility was open, and I had a chat with two strangers over a cup of tea.

Two days later I went to see my GP. Sat in her office, distraught and certain that I wouldn't make it out this time. But wanting to. I was prescribed an anti-depressant, and set off not really knowing what was around the corner.

Then I started to make some plans. I hadn't really done that since... Well, ever really. I started going to my sister's for dinner, helping my niece annotate war poems, calling my best friend every other day, visiting old friends. I even got bitten by a horse.

I'm in the drivers seat again. It's like I've woken up at the wheel just as I'm about to hit a tree. Just in time for my instincts to swerve, and pile this bad boy into a corn field.

The point of this? It's for anyone who's currently lying motionless. Reach out. Find your place again. It's not over yet.

Okay, here it goes...

**Background**

Throughout my life, I have had globs of academic and personal goals. I love to build things, learn about science and math, and solve interesting and challenging problems.

I have never been much of a procrastinator, and usually am driven by my scientific pursuits, but within the last few years things have changed. The deeper I get into the rabbit hole that is science and math, the more I find myself  asking the question of ""why are we here and what the heck is the point of all this."" I ask myself this question constantly; when I get up in morning, when I brush my teeth, etc.

**The Problem(s)**

1.) Unfortunately (and unsurprisingly), this question can be quite unmotivating and cause one to feel lost. Despite trying to create a daily schedule, get off social media, quite nicotine, quit pulling my hair and biting my nails, quit watching porn, etc., I still find myself procrastinating and clinging to my aforementioned addictions in order to have something concrete in my life. 

2.) I have been trying to work on being more ""present"" in my daily life, as this is a common solution to dealing with the problem of feeling lost. However, this is challenging for me as I have a tendency to be very excited about a new topic or idea and then completely lose my drive to pursue the idea further once the excitement of ""doing something new"" fades away. This causes me to stop being ""present"" and revert back to my bad habits. (P.S. I used to NOT have this problem, again this started a few years ago)

**The Rub**

It is only when I am surrounded by nature, that this feeling of being ""lost"" fades away. I recently took a ski trip to Big Sky with a club at school, and just being surrounded by snow, animals, and trees gave me my motivation back. Throughout the trip I was reading papers, writing emails, and journaling in my personal physics notebook. BUT, the minute I got back to school (in the city) my motivation plummeted, and the ""lost"" feeling returned. Now, I can barely get out of bed and am late to all my lectures.

**TLDR;** Feeling lost in life because I simply cannot fathom why we exist at all, and it has caused me to cling to addictions rather than reality and  to lose the high level of drive I used to have.",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,592995,public,confidence,self,Why are we here and what the heck is the point of all this (feeling lost),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/esl0d4/why_are_we_here_and_what_the_heck_is_the_point_of/,no_ads,0.0

in the last few days I'm really struggling with my depression and social anxiety. Again and again it stands out that I have a big lack of stimulation and with it problems concentrating and remembering. Many times I was thinking about the question if my (undiagnosed) ADD symptoms come from my depression and social anxiety or if it's the other way round as any usual treatments for depression/anxiety didn't seem to help yet.

Is there anybody of you who found out that his depression and/or anxiety was wrong diagnosed and cause of ADD/ADHD? Any other ideas or contributions?

Text:
""An unrecognized ADHD can carry a high risk of negative developments and the development of other diseases. For example, untreated and more severe ADHD is associated with the risk of an inadequate life course, the development of other comorbidities such as addiction and depression, as well as partnership, family and professional difficulties. Furthermore, even in the case of undiagnosed ADHD, there is a fundamental risk of misdiagnosis of neighbouring disorders or embarrassing diagnoses, which may result in ineffective therapies and a worsening of the symptoms.""",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,592996,public,confidence,self,Depression and anxiety because of ADD?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/esl0ms/depression_and_anxiety_because_of_add/,no_ads,0.0

Normally I guess I would cry during days like that. I'm on antidepressants more than a year now I started taking them at age 20.
Usually I feel okay but the thing is I can't cry. Like I just don't cry anymore when I'm on my meds. It's good because crying was my fucking favourite thing to do when I'm: depressed, sad or scared.
Now I'm kind of just living with all those feelings. I can't just cry it out to the moment of being tired and fall asleep. Last couple of day all of this thinking and sadnes just exist within me.

I've been depressed for most of my (20 M) life and the last three years have been a nightmare that wont end. All my friends left me after high school and the girl I had been dating for almost three years doesnt want anything to do with me, which I guess is good because she was kinda emotionally abusive,  but I still miss her. 

I first tried to kill myself two years ago and since then I've had off and on suicidal thoughts but lately they've gotten worse, my anxiety has gotten worse and i had a panic attack at work. Something that never happens.

I'm lonely. I'm so so lonely. I only hang out with two people: one is a former roommate who I used to live with until I tried to kill myself two years ago and I know he at least used to hate me (I worry he still does), because I know he tried to use my attempted suicide as a way to hit on girls by making himself the hero. And the other is my cousin who is ten years older than me, and while hes awesome I sometimes wonder if he only hangs out with me because we're cousins because he almost never answers my calls or texts and often when he says we will hang out we dont because hes not home. Which I guess is because of work sometimes but still....i dont really know how to feel about it..

Anyways, I've been spending alot of time lately thinking about suicide. All i seem to do is get in trouble and financially screw my parents over on accident.  I still live at home with them and I just dont want to be a burden on them anymore. I've caused them so many problems and cost them so much money and I know I'll cost them more money because next month I have a personal thing I have to attend to in another state and I guess they're coming with me, which I am grateful for because I'm terrified of it.

I'm scared, I spend most of my work days zoned out thinking about suicide.  I spent like 3-4 hours today thinking about it, like how I would do it and when I would and I feel like I'm going insane. Sometimes I can feel the chemical imbalance in my head telling me to end it all and I just want it to stop. Whether by killing myself or something else I dont care. And I'm scared the ""suicide"" option will come to save me before the ""something else"" option does.

I need help but I dont have health insurance and I'm already in debt. I dont know what to do and I dont know how much longer I can take this. I cant talk to anyone in my family because I'd either get brushed off as an emo kid because I cant explain exactly why I feel this way or they'd just say ""man up"" and get over it

Because life isn’t worth it. To me, this is just a story. Building relationships with people &amp; creating new experiences just to fill a 100 year time slot. Juggling human emotions, expectations, morals, fears, dreams...then to juggle those things coming from outside yourself, multiplied by however many influences you pass in the century.. it’s as incomprehensible as any reason given to continue. Seeing the never ending cycle of good &amp; bad constantly chip away at everything in existence just numbs the senses. Survival instinct transforms into the call into the void. Every potential end I’ve faced becomes a sweet memory of how my story almost got a happy ending. 

I tire of trying to balance my mental health. I know how easily I can change my mind but something deep in my soul is convinced that waiting time out will never be worth it. How could it ever be worth it when I know I’ll always circle back? 

I’ve tried to value many things to replace the lack of faith I have in life. Besides self love, I tried caring for others &amp; for earth itself. It worked but like all thoughts &amp; actions, feelings are temporary. Nothing will ever manage to make my life content- it’s just how I am. 

I appreciate the comedic irony in life, don’t get me wrong. The fact insecurity even exists is proof humans have been so evil to each other for so long that we’ve evolved to have survival traits that’d otherwise be useless. Death being addictive is the star paradox. How is it beneficial to yearn for nothingness? Drug and adrenaline addicts at least have clear benefits, but this? Could suicidal tendencies be an evolved trait like insecurity? Could it be that someone truly can be born without the will to live? Maybe it’s all simply a fatal combination of parenting styles &amp; environment etc etc. Whatever things that happened to/for/with/near me to make me so capable of things most ppl never dream of doing is a haunting blank space. Tons of shitty things happened but the reason I want to die never changes. I feel like a burden. And I feel like a burden because existing as me is a burden. Existing at all is a burden. I don’t even bother covering up how I feel with drugs and shit anymore because it just made it so much easier to overdose or to slit my throat. 




-Stupid additional words that are also a-
Trigger Warning:::
Both actually happened, overdose happened a couple times,  &amp; I’m fucking shocked I’m still alive too lmao. My family didn’t even know it was happening when the paramedics busted in my house. My fucked up self sent a good bye to someone smart enough to call 911 even though they were in a different country. Genuinely still pissed to this day there wasn’t more traffic or something to let me bleed for a few more seconds. As you can imagine, dying felt fucking amazing then Im resurrected in absolute hell where I was legally required to take meds &amp; had to deal with everyone’s reactions. I cut up and deep as shit because I had taken all of the klonopin I was prescribed on top of alcohol so I had almost 100 stitches total. Saw the inner workings of my arm &amp; had nearly 20 stitches in my throat. Seeing my mom see was probably the worst thing to this day but as you can probably tell- I’m almost proud of how horrible it was because I got so close to saying goodbye. I know I sound super sick for almost enjoying such a brutal suicide attempt but besides the overwhelming urge to be dead- I’m a really empathetic and caring person so hurting my loved ones like that really really reallly hurt me. To be honest though, I think they’re the selfish ones because the only reason they try to force me to stay alive is so that they don’t have to deal with me not being here. I guess I just have to wait till my parents die to off myself guilt free lmao. 


PS 

I’ve been doing the antidepressants and mental health professional dance for 20 years over my depression. Yes antidepressants helped in some ways. But they destroyed other aspects of my personality &amp; life. I’ve tried many, I’ve stuck with some for years, but ultimately I’m happier as who I am even though I’m battling that specific demon. And honestly, I have 2 jobs, Im back in college, life is good as long as I can afford enough weed to stay off the ledge. I know I said I don’t do drugs to cover but I literally mean I smoke a blunt if I feel like stabbing myself then everything’s better &amp; that’s not different than if I was still prescribed klonopin 🤷‍♀️",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,593021,public,confidence,self,Only livin by not dyin,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eslm8m/only_livin_by_not_dyin/,no_ads,0.0

If your parents are shitty and raise you poorly, if you have no manners, are rude, or not fun to be around even if its unintentional, you have less opportunities to grow. You have less opportunities to improve yourself and get better. People dont care about you as much, many people hate you for all the things that were out of your control, so you hate yourself for shit that you had no CHOICE over. 

So attractive unintelligent kids who are good at shallow pointless conversations and not questioning reality get to grow up, get to learn from their mistakes and experiences. They get better at making friends and get to go on with a healthy mindset better equipped to deal with heartbreak and tragedy. They can handle holding a job and are great with interacting with their other asshole peers who rule every successful industry, and they get to be rich and successful. 

Meanwhile the “other kids” get left in the dust. Grow to be 20 year olds with barely any experience in social interaction, hate themselves, are friends with other kids on the internet who are in the same boat, who keep oscillating the same shit that keeps them held down and spreading toxic beliefs. So those people get fucked. From shit they dont get to choose which just ripples across the rest of their timeline ensuring theyll have a shitty life, the only life they get.

Let’s start with highschool ,I was a complete fuck up, missed out on everything cause I was to busy doing/selling drugs and hanging out with a fucked up Crowd.
Eventually Graduated in alternative school , 6 months later then my peers after moving 3 schools.
This led to the deterioration of my image within all the people who knew me then.
I stupidly decided to take awhile off from any sort of school,to work construction labouring job untill I decided to try for college (pretty recently, some reason never wanted to try till now) which I’m still waiting for a response, knowing how much I fuck up it won’t be good.

With Woman I had one successful relationship a long time ago , where I genuinely loved this girl,untill Late 2016 When it ended. After that I got cheated on by my 2 exes after Which broke my trust barrier with Woman ALOT. Since my last break up in Early 2018, I’ve been generally mostly led on,used for sex only or stood up, even if I had strong feelings for them, my looks are usually all that I have to offer to most woman. Something about my personality and the way I am that no one would ever consider dating me anymore, which has led me to the fact that I’m probably better off alone. 
I smoke weed everyday, maybe .7-1 gram a day because it’s one of the last things keeping my mood stable and me not wanting to off myself.
I come off as happy as I go out and party with my friends every weekend and always seem bliss, maybe cause that’s the only time I don’t feel like such a nobody is when I’m around the few ppl who tolerate me.
I’m gettin close to the end of the line, some friends know I’m depressed but They don’t know it’s this bad.

On the last year of 2019 I had another breakdown. I was struggling with juggling university work, mainly my thesis, and other obligations while also keeping up with therapy and getting used to ever-increasing doses of antidepressants, seemingly without effect.

That day I decided I would put my health first and put nothing above myself. 

Of course things don’t always go smoothly, nor do they always feel right when followed through with; my meds still aren’t doing much for me and I’m closing in on the maximum dosage; my doctor has urged me to visit a psychiatrist in tandem with the psychologist I am already seeing, this might help get better medication as well. Overall I don’t feel any beter than when I even admitted to my family what I truly feel like, but I do feel secure knowing people are supporting me and helping me to find a way up.

Sadly all if this did mean I had to drop out of university for the foreseeable future; I can’t keep up with the workload let alone finish my thesis; I barely have any energy to go see my therapist let alone study, Let Alone work which is an issue but my councilor presented me with some solutions to get through the initial period at least, as far as income goes anyway. 

It still hurts, it feels like I’m giving up and failing even though I know it’s for the better. It got me even lower and it started my year in a ditch. I’m feel like I am in no position to do anything but wait - wait to see therapists and doctors, wait to hear what they think, wait to try new exercises or methods or pills, wait to see if said pills even work or that it’s just the side effects I’m gonna notice. But I keep hoping it will get better.

I had no real goal writing this but I would actually like to end with this; I know it’s a messy write-up and it seems whiny, but if anything, see that it pays to put yourself first in times like these! It cost me a lot of effort but I got the support network in place now to move forward. Don’t give up, there are ways to find the help you need when you really need it - be it a student councilor or a professor, family or a therapist, even a GP might hold the key to your next step, even if that next step is the first of another 100. I’m not here yet myself, but please.

Then I went to South America and did some sh*t intern job at a graphic design company. I was depressed then I took a vacation on a vacation and met some cousins I had never met before. We did alcohol and shit but then on the second night I did acid. Man life hasn’t been the same since, I had felt such a strong sense of absolute FREEDOM and when the high ended I passed out in the car returning to the city I was staying before the mini vacation. Everything since was a blur. Days and weeks gone and still go by! I realized how pathetic my life is! My parents limit me! I want to make music and play games and be myself but I can’t! I get home and I have time for nothing! Do this and do that! I was bullied freshman year in high school and I had forgotten everything about it, then a month after the high the memories came back. I can’t go anywhere without familiar faces because I feel anxiety and my neck spasms and I can’t move or speak! I’m failing the classes I picked last year in high school and the school won’t help me!!! I even tried to make the depression go away by talking to this girl I knew from the previous year, but that drove me really down. I didn’t know about this other kid she liked, so I guess out of a state of despair I told her I liked her, I walked home in a terrible state and she called me and I said some things. The kid hates me for making her cry, fuck him! she was a person I talked to regularly and he was there and fucked it all up. Whatever I don’t care anymore but everytime I seen them walk around the school I get disgusted! It made me stop trying any relationships. I am currently in a state of despair, and I’m not sure where I’m going and where the journey will be. I don’t want to be poor and homeless, I don’t want to be seen as a mentally ill person. I take some of lithium orotate that my mom bought for my dad in secret and my god, it’s the only damn thing that helps with the spasms in my neck and the anxiety in general. I have trouble sleeping and I don’t think I can take more of this any longer.

I had weight loss surgery a week ago today. The combination of not being able to eat, not wanting to fuck it up, and having been off my meds for a week really messed with me. I feel like I made the biggest mistake of my life by having this. And I felt it from the second I woke up, which I’m told is experienced by pretty much everyone who has the surgery. But on top of the normal “buyers remorse” of having surgery, I am fighting myself with eating. And the more I try to explain it, the less people understand. I am hungry. Not for steak or chicken nuggets, but just for literally anything. But every time I try to put food into my body, my brain spirals and creates a psychological effect of blocking off the hunger. So I take a sip, my brain tells me I’m full, but my stomach is still screaming in hunger.  This misery made me give up. So I’ve just been drinking water as I can. Which isn’t much. 

This lack of nutrients has my body extra exhausted, and my brain is too. I’ve thought of thousands of ways to die already. I’m not suicidal, but I don’t want to live anymore. I’m tired. And it just feels like my body is confirming that I fucked up and I did the wrong thing. 

On top of that, I work for my dad. But I’ve been so exhausted I can’t go back to work and he is mad. I know he’s not actually mad, but I feel the silent unavoidable anger he feels but doesn’t show.

Didn't feel like she was getting anywhere. That's about it when it comes to any kind of treatment.

I'm working on that part now, talking on the phone gives me anxiety but I'm going to email someone from my insurance company about where I can go, and start from there. 

What I'd like to know, though, is what your experiences have been, specifically with the process of seeing a physician for the first time, talking about your depression, getting diagnosed (I have been diagnosed already, but I'm no longer an adolescent.), and any tips you might have to make the journey easier.

I’ve had depression my whole life, and it’s mostly self managed. I’ve also been diagnosed with PTSD from time in combat. 

I’ve always had some anxiety as well but it never became an issue until I had my son (2 next week) I’d been dealing with it on my own and I was also able to help my symptoms with medical marijuana since it’s legal in my state once I had separated from the military, but I got pregnant again and didn’t feel comfortable using MMJ although it helped immeasurably, due to the lack of research. 

Led me to find a therapist once I realized I wasn’t coping well on my own anymore. She seems ok, I don’t know what to expect but she seems kinda forgetful. For instance in December I switched insurance and had a gap, I called her Monday and left a message to tell her I would have to miss our Wednesday session and resume the next week. She called me back Monday and we confirmed I wouldn’t be there Wednesday, she forgot we spoke and called me Tuesday and we had the same conversation and then she called Wednesday during my appointment time to ask where I was. 

My husband started seeing her in December, in January we went to one session together during his time due to the holidays and at my next session she was like “oh alone today?” as if I hadn’t been coming individually for the past 8 weeks. 

What bothers me most is the last week I’ve been having a ROUGH time and my depression has been awful. I spent most of the weekend in bed crying, I feel really overwhelmed and I have had hysterical almost violent outbursts from the smallest thing, like my Amazon Echo not hearing a command. She has been considering I may have a mild bipolar but we haven’t reached that far. 

Anyway, today I went in prepared to really dive into how dark of a place I’ve been in, because if I’m having an even kinda good day I usually make it seem like everything is okay in my session. She was running 10 minutes behind, no big deal. 

The whole time when I was trying to elaborate on how bad it’s been, she seemed to just try to tell me I needed to find someone to help with my son for when I get overwhelmed, besides my husband because I rely on him too much and put too much pressure on him. I have a good support system of friends and family but yes my husband is my default go to to vent because we are partners. 

She then promptly ended my session 10 mins early. Which, with her running late gave me 40 mins of my 60 min session. I don’t mean to seem ungrateful but I feel like the first time I opened up I was dismissed in several ways. 

Oh I was also called a spoiled brat when I said I was having a hard time coping and bottling up feelings because I can’t do my normal things to decompress, the main one is playing rugby.

It’s hard to explain. I think my body wants to sleep, but my mind doesn’t.

I like staying up late, I’m all alone at night. Nobody is judging me, or screaming at me, or telling me what to do. But it’s sometimes scary when I’m paranoid. Sometimes I feel like there are people around me, staring and pointing at me. I don’t know.

But still, even though I’m paranoid sometimes, I don’t like to go to sleep. Sometimes I don’t feel like I deserve it, and not sleeping enough is one of the only things that makes me feel better. I kinda get numb when I’m tired. It’s better than feeling.

I don’t like to feel, because when I feel, the feelings are mostly bad. My heart sometimes feel so heavy I’m barely able to stand up. It’s like someone has just punched me in the stomach, and I’m feeling the pain spreading everywhere. Feelings are painful, they rip me into small pieces. Feelings are overwhelming.

Numbness is really something else. It’s nice to not feel anything if you’ve been feeling too much for a while. The numbness is comforting, it’s calming. I sometimes really like being numb. But the numbness can also be too much. When you don’t feel anything for weeks, stuff gets boring. You start to feel empty, it’s like somebody just opened your chest, grabbed your heart, and ripped it out of your chest. It’s a weird feeling, being empty.

I felt like I’ve been depressed for a year now but I always thought I was either overthinking it or just being dramatic. I felt like I could deal with it myself and it’s “just a little sadness and it’ll go away”. Instead it’s gotten worse and worse. Writing this on here was a struggle for me because I feel like I’m just overreacting.

I can’t tell what exactly dug me in this hole. Maybe it’s school, maybe it’s the people around me, maybe it’s even both. Or better yet it’s probably myself. I always get upset and constantly overthink things. When I overthink it gets to a point where I feel like I’m about to throw up. 

I feel tired all the time and I’ve noticed that I’ve been losing my concentration, which affects me in school. Then when it comes to tests for specific classes, I stress myself thinking about it and start to doubt my knowledge. Once when I have the test my mind blanks out and completely forgets. Once when I get home I stress myself about the grade. It has driven me to a point where I don’t have motivation anymore. I feel like I’m trying so hard on something I can’t do.

I’m sorry if it sounds like I’m complaining or venting btw. 

Finally, I think I cry too much. Maybe it’s me being too sensitive but once when I overthink something, it goes from sadness, to anger, to guilt, then that’s when I cry. It usually happens at night so I’ll just cry myself to sleep. The next morning I’ll wake up and feel normal. If it’s something that bothers me too much to where it goes to where I’m crying in the morning, then I try to distract myself by going on my phone. This summer I had been crying each night for a week straight. But that was probably my lowest point.
I feel like I’ve been getting no sleep because I’m constantly tired. I’m surprised how i make it though each day. 

Ok so now here’s the real problem. I know there’s something wrong, because a usual person doesn’t do this that often/ daily. I just don’t know how I should bring it up to my parents. What should I say and how should I say it? 

I had never express my emotions to anyone before and it feels weird to do so.

I oscillate between periods of being highly motivated and being a sloth. And it's not just emotional, it has physical causes too. For the last few years I've been living in a small town working an isolating job which has made my situation much worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

I finally made a bold decision of quitting my job and going on an adventure but I still don't have much real energy (other than fantasy making).   I'll have to move soon but I don't even feel like sorting out my stuff.  I don't quite see the point of ""making something out of myself"". I often wonder what pushes other people, what's their source of motivation. There are days when I work hard but they are quite scarce and I've not been able to find a pattern. Doctor prescribed me Adderall but it's lost it's effects. (Not going to increase the dose; it's literally a drug.)

&amp;#x200B;

And this whole thing is a shame, when I look at my peers and see they have much more recognition/career advancement/social network and what not compared to me. A shame because I'm certifiably a smart guy and have made a lot of effort in my life. I think what happened was that misfortunes and not being able to get what I want from life put me off. That together with isolation and health issues.... Near the middle age I often think it's not possible to turn my life around. But that's not the correct statement. I should say I can't imagine my life being happy and successful.

These always come at the same time - October/November through to late January/early February. About ten years ago I started taking citalopram 20mg daily. I've gone off and on a few times over the years, but for the last two years I've taken it consistently.

Don't get any noticeable side effects, BUT, I have kept having the depressive episodes at the same time of year. They are as bad as they've ever been.

For a couple of years in a row, I added bupropion (AKA Wellbutrin) during the bad period, again with no appreciable effect.

Talked to the doctor today &amp; we agreed that the citalopram isn't having the effect I want. I'm going to start tapering off at the end of February (I have a mountain-biking thing mid-Feb, and when coming off citalopram in the past, I've got the vertigo/dizziness thing people talk about).

I've always been fine over autumn/winter (I'm in New Zealand), so I'm not going to take anything over that time.

I'll go to see the doctor in around August, and start on venlafaxine then, to give it time to take effect (here's hoping) before the depression kicks in a couple of months later like it always does.

I've read lots of both good and bad things about venlafaxine, but have read similar horror stories about citalopram, none of which happened to me.

Does anyone else have a similar experience with these two drugs?

TL;DR: been on citalopram for 2yrs+, depressive episodes still happening. Going to change to venlafaxine a couple of months before the depression would normally kick in.

Anyone who wants to talk to me has a financial motive, or is also a hopeless friendless looser who hasn't had their humanity completely burned away inside of them. 

There is nothing for but to forced to spent most of my time at work and slowly die. I have tried everything I can to be happy and every possible thing ended in failure or anxiety or fear or anger or depression. 

I gain nothing for remaining alive. I gain nothing from any relationship, even from attempting again to find one.

I can't possibly make you read it all, so I'll try to sum up a bit.

We've been together for more than 4 years now, married for a year and a half. She's been type 1 diabetic since teenage and depressed since first few month of our relationship. I seriously don't know what to do anymore. I'm completely exhausted, it all feels pointless anyway. No matter what I do, there will always be something wrong which will start a storm. Can never seem to make it right 100%. She wants to get divorce. She was on antidepressants for a year, but it only made her numb, her memory would deteriorate and she didn't seem happy or less sad anyway, more like empty. (plus I do not really believe in antidepressants, since serotonin lvls have very little to do with sadness and depression.) I've been hit, pushed, kicked countless times. she cut my long hair. punch in the face was new, I've experienced that one about a week ago. she broke so many of my or our things. flush new phone, cut clothes,... but what hurts the most are words, those really made me doubt myself up to an extend I lost touch with reality. I was believing I am the worst, I am the reason, I make her suffer, starve, I torture her as a game and laugh at her suffering. I mean, there must be some truth there, otherwise she wouldn't feel that way, would she? Does it feel bad? Of course, but in the difficult moments I always tell myself: yeah, you suffer, but imagine how much she has to be suffering inside that it results in such behaviour.   
But now I don't know what to do anymore. I've lost the will. I've lost the energy. during the first two years, if she hit me I hugged her (not that it did any good), after a night of hell I'd write her a poem, get her flowers and made her a breakfast to bed. Now I barely feel sad, when she's crying and breaking things and shouting at me. I've become emotionally unavailable. I understand it as my defence mechanism, but it makes her feel completely alone. whenever I feel something is coming up I just turn off my emotions. I can feel it in my face immediately when it happens. if I see myself in the mirror I see a completely heartless person, but as I said, it is not under my control. only lately I've managed to stay emotional here and there, so I shout back or become desperate and cry, but it doesn't solve the problem. 

I want you to know that I am really not perfect. she's been telling me there's a lack of communication and I admit it. even tho I'm an extroverted person, I tend to keep things to myself. I've always had a theory if it's nothing positive, sharing it will do no good and better keep it to yourself. yet as I learn, it is better to get angry and shout or have an argument most of the times in the relationship. that way it gets out and when it's over you're closer than before. yeah, I'm just learning this whole marriage thing... 

we were supposed to leave for our holiday apartment yesterday, so we can celebrate my birthday there. which is today. she wasn't feeling well today, as most of the days, due to her diabetes. I kept asking her throughout the day what can I do for her, if she'd like to eat something, what would she like... she said she needs to wash her hair, but doesn't have strength I offered to prepare her a bath and wash and then brush and dry her hair. I've done it many times. she always refused and didn't want anything from me, didn't want me to pack her bag or to eat, so I thought the best help would be if I get my things ready and our together things, load the car and do everything I can do. she packed herself meanwhile and went to nap, asked me to wake her up in 15 minutes. I did so, she said she doesn't have the strength to go. (important information: I haven't got a driving license. so she has to do the driving. and yes, she's been asking me to get it for last three years, but I didn't. I've started now, but this is definitely big big fault of mine) was I disappointed? yes. did I make it show? I don't think so. it's something I've learned to be always ready for. it is not her fault.(!!) she asked me to open my birthday gift, as she's been asking me for last three days, since it arrived. I said I'd like to open it tomorrow, on my actual birthday. (is it weird? might be) she got a fit of rage and threw out of the window. and shouted at me for I never do what she wants even tho it's irrelevant. I should just do it to make her happy. I went for the gift, it was wrapped so I knew it's undamaged. she asked me to open it again, I did. it was beats earplugs I thanked her a lot. I've wanted good headphones or earplugs and she knew it and got them for me. but the atmosphere was weird because of her behaviour, I tried to hug her, but I told her I wanted to just open it on my birthday (I shouldn't have) and she got mad again and tore apart the earplugs. spilled the beer I got myself to relax myself in the bed, threw the glass in the corner, ate all her clonazepams (emergency pills for anxiety), told me she's divorcing me tomorrow and went to sleep to the other room. 

She even applied for the divorce papers a week ago, but then we went for our first couple therapy the next day a things seemed to get a bit better. I was working on my communication and listening and she on not being so critical. it really feels like it's over now. I don't know what to do. I've never believed in divorce, I gave my promise to be there in sickness and in health. I believe all can be sorted and worked out. I believe we still love each other. I am sure we do. it is nothing I didn't know about before the wedding. have I failed as a partner? have I failed as a compassionate being? I'm feeling like I don't know anything anymore.

This is isn't to say things get better but, I can't believe I almost missed out on happiness, even if it was momentarily.

My name is John, I have posted here once before. This is also my second ever post on reddit so excuse any mistakes I make.

To make a long story short, I hate how I'm feeling, and I want it to stop.
Nothing in life feels right anymore. Nothing in my world feels like it's going to be okay. I'm a senior in highschool, it's my last year, I almost done. I bombed my entire last semester and my only hope of graduation this semester is cramming my schedule full of shit I need to graduate. 2 English classes, 3 math classes, 2 science classes. I hate being pressured the way I am to graduate. I hate that no matter what I do and what I try I can never get up the necessary energy to do the things I need to do. I smoke, I drink. They help sometimes. I'm drunk most days at school. I'm high more often. It's the only way I can get through without breaking down in every class because at this point I'm so far behind all the numbers and letters on the board are gibberish. My life is falling apart and I want nothing more than this feeling of pain and uselessness to stop. I'm not good enough. I'm not driven enough. I got a 30 on my ACT (for non Americans it's a college placement test basically, with a highest possible score of 36) so technically I'm pretty smart. But the only thing my intelligence does for me these days is continue to allow me to see how fucked the world I live in is. I can see when people look at my weird because I haven't showered in days. I can make hear people talk about me when they think they're being quiet. I can feel the teachers faces contort when they see I haven't done my homework for the 4th week straight. I'm a failure. I'm an alcoholic, stoner, sex addicted, unhappy, depressed,,,failure. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I can make it.

We fell in love, actually.

The school found out about it and she was fired, leaving me a suicidal and depressed mess. I need some help, anyone willing to reach out please do. I loved her so much and miss her immensely, despite it being taboo.

This a throwaway btw. To start, I’ve have my bouts with depressive episodes in the past, but I’ve never really been diagnosed with it. I just sorta have these really really lows sometimes, and I just got outta one, but I’m still kinda in it. Recently, as in since the summer recently, I’ve begun working with my ex girlfriend’s sister. We’d been really good friends since the time when I dated her sister, so we worked well together. Flash forward to November. I’d spent time with this girl in and out of work week after week. We were incredibly close and would talk all the time. She’s one person in my life that I can be completely me around, and someone who gets me more than anyone else does. As you can imagine, I grew feelings for her. Eventually it got to the point where my guilt was so painful I had panic attacks for the first un my life about it. I don’t want to downplay how I felt by saying that, since I feel like a lot of people say “panic attack” as a statement that means a lot of things. I couldn’t breathe, I felt like someone kicked me in the stomach, and I couldn’t really get a grip on reality. After this began, I caved and told her how I felt. I just couldn’t take it anymore. She blamed herself for the feelings I had, despite admitting to having some feelings herself. A week passed by after this, and despite everything, I still feel comfortable around her. It’s like all my stress and my worry and everything bad goes away. That night, a man approached me. Turns out my father wanted to meet me for the first time in my life. I’d already been stressed enough about the girl, I’ll refer to as C, so this kind of peaked it. My father left around when I was born, fought to give the least amount of child support, and now he wanted to have a place in my life. He’s not someone who feels emotion, he’s actually more or less a sociopath. Now I’m here. It’s been about a month since then. My father came in to my work again, attempting to manipulate me with a card full of pictures of my siblings on his side of the family. I’m technically a bastard son, since my mom only had me with my father while they weren’t married. I guess I needed to get this all out. Everyday I think about C. It’s painful. I don’t know what to do about it. I want things to go back to normal, but it feels like it’s impossible. Maybe this is better suited for

I've had MDD since I was a kid, I would self harm in various ways in primary school. Mental health is just a part of life for me. 

I'm 28 now. I've been on one medication or another for more than half my life. I dont even know who I am without SSRIs. But anyway, medications usually work for 1 - 2 years before I develop a resistance or something and I drop back into a severe depression until we find something new. I also have mini cycles of depression, where I'll be okay for 4-6 weeks then spend a week incredibly depressed, and the following week recovering. It's usually during these times that I cry, self harm, indulge in drug abuse (prescription and marijuana). 

I had been going well for the longest sustained period in years. I'd been good for nearly 2 whole months, and even through the Christmas period which has several triggers for me on top of being regular stressful.  

I thought my mum was on my side. The other day, whilst arguing with dad, she told me that I was part of why she was miserable. Because I'm ""so gloomy all the time"". This triggered a massive downward spiral.

That night I lost my shit. I drank a lot of whisky, then wine when i ran out. I had 3 zopiclones, 3 quetiapine, 5 2.5mg lorazepam, half a dozen codeine. Then i hit the bong and smoked several grams. I just wanted to not feel what I was feeling. I woke up in the middle of the night choking on vomit. I've overdosed many times before, usually never enough to endanger my life though. When I realised what ~~had happened~~ I had done it hit me like a tonne of bricks. My emotional walls came up, my emotions shut down, and I've been numb ever since. 

I cant talk to her. I cant let her see what I'm feeling, and going back to suppressing it is drowning me. I cant even cry. 

I'm scared of what I'll do with this feeling.

For a while now my marriage has been hanging by a thread. I have been doing everything I can to mend what I am able to. While at the same time attempting to both heal and remake myself into a person I would rather be. But this process has been slow. Slower than I ever thought it would be. This was just me being naive in truth, but still. Its kind of disheartening to want something so bad, but be held back by my own shortcomings and barriers. Still I can keep going, with just a faint glimmer of my goal on the other side. Its humbling to have your hopes dashed apart by your own failings. 

It's hard to enjoy life when you go to work everyday dreading it. Also when you soend the days leading up to your return dreading it. Its not that my job is hard, its just taking a heavy toll. Between the constant drama, cliques, and backstabbing. Included with the exhaustion of night shift, the loss of time with my family, and the distance it has widened with my wife. It's just draining me of all my will. Being gone half the week, and sleeping through the day. I feel like I am never on the ssme page with the people i love and care about. 

To top it all off I feel like my future is so horrifically limited. In my career path there is little to no opportunity to expand. I can seek the next level of my field, but that is so much work and expense for a tiny increase in pay. Even with that I am never guaranteed or even likely to advance beyond my starting position and wages. I love the line of work I am in, but I will never be a real provider for my family, i will always make starvation wages for a job that claims the lives and sanity of many better people. To what end? 

So while all of this is going on, i feel like i have been kicked further. I don't understand why I feel this way, but I do. My wife had a miscarriage a few days ago. Initially I was concerned for her feelings, and only felt slightly sad at the event. But in the last 2 days it has become a constant source of pain and anxiety for me. On one hand I see the pain and suffering this has brought her, and I want nothing more than to help her through that. But i am at a loss for what to say, so I just giver her my hand, a hug, a kiss, some gentle words. On the other hand I feel like I have lost something or someone I love. Even though I never even knew it existed. I have wanted a second child for a few years now, but it has never been the right time, now especially. We could never afford a second child as it is. We have little to no extra time for our daughter as it is. Our relationship is not stable enough for this type of stress. My wife is in school and would struggle with the added pressure of pregnancy and with a newborn. As much as I would like to help, it would not be my burden to carry and birth it. So why, with all of these things saying its ok to not have this child. Why do i feel so damned heartbroken over it?

The pregnancy tests were all negative, much to our delight. So i had no reason to even get attached to the idea of another child. But still I find myself thinking about names. About if I would have finally had a son, or another daughter. I see myself holding a faceless newborn with tears in my eyes. Thinking i would do it right this time. Because i was so unprepared the last time, i never really got to appreciate those early days with my daughter. I woke up from a nightmare last night, in which my unborn child was hurt. I found myself crying on my way to work, just thinking about what could have been. This sucks. My wife miscarried once before, and i only felt slightly bad. Mostly for her. She has been on implanted birth control for 7 years. So i never dreamed a child would come up unexpectedly. But this one. This one hurts deep. Its consumed me with fear, depression, and anxiety. I can't even imagine what my wife feels.

The other day, my boyfriend and I were talking, and somehow got on the subject of weight... he talked about thin this, being skinny that, how he disliked bigger people, talked down about them, said fat and big stomachs and double chins were gross... just things like that.

Without thinking, I said, “don’t worry, one day I’ll be thin and you won’t have to worry and you’ll be happy!”
It was almost automatic... and at that moment, I lost all confidence in myself and wondered why and for who was I doing this for. He replied with “I love you the way you are.” 
But inside, I asked my self, how can he say that when I am and have all those things he hates?

But, at the same time, I feel so shitty all the time. Before anything, let me give you all a overall picture of my life.

I am bisexual male, I live in a place where people are super religious and grew to hear homophobic stuff like ""this is a sin"" and biphobic things like ""you are just gay and scared to be seen that way"". That, by itself, is a great fuel to a conflict to find an identity. But, when I came out, everybody was incredibly supportive and stopped with the LGBTphobic comments. I'm finishing my course and the university is totally comprehensive and supportive when my illness gets in the way. I had a job where everybody were trying to make me feel good all the time. But, even with this, I feel so... lifeless.

It's like I'm not really a part of this world, of this reality. It's like I was born at the wrong place at the wrong time. My friends hesitate everytime that they do a party because they don't know if I'm going to be fine or to have fun there (to sum up, my tastes are *way* different compared to everybody else). My tastes make me struggle to connect with my family because they like what I don't and vice-versa, so there's only that mutual respect for everyone else. My romantic life is a complete struggle because, and my fellow bis will understand that, men see me as someone afraid to come out as gay while women think that I'll only try to use them to fake that I'm not gay (to this day, I'm 25 years old and never dated nor kissed anybody). And the worst part of this romantic life is that, five years ago I declared myself to my best friend and he said he was straight. Last year, on my freaking birthday, he said he was dating... a guy. And that made me feel so undesirable that I haven't had any affairs from that day until now. 

All of this are normal problems in other peoples lives, but, because of my illness, it seems like life itself it's constantly sending a message that I don't belong and never will. That no matter how much I try, things will not get better. That my life will only be these ""almosts"". Accepted as a bisexual, but never dating anyone. Have one amazing person in my life and being in love with him, but never able to have him as anything else than a friend. Never being excluded nor hated by everyone in my life, but never truly being a part of things. It'll only be this limbo of never happy, but never have my sadness, my loneliness ""justified"" by what happens in my life. And it's frustrating to the core.

I'm only making this post because writing relieves this heaviness in my heart and to know if someone feels the same way that I feel. Because it sucks to feel alone.

But it made me feel like absolute shit, feel degraded. And she would say it in a way where it looks like it turned her on. She fucking used to scare me. 

She called me ""vagina"" (it was like a nickname) and i started crying and yelling at her and was asking her why she would always do this to me but not to my sibling and it's because ""you're a girl"". That was always and excuse. She used to be obsessed with the idea of us sleeping with each out. She once cuddled up to be, cupping/grabbing my vagina and said ""mommy will hold your vagina until i fall asleep"". Fucking disgusting. She used to say ""I'll rip your vagina off"" and grab it/pinch it and make a disgusting face like she was getting off on it or something.

When I was younger I thought life would be great when I got older but it’s constantly gotten worse since 17. I’m 20 now and my problems are getting really damaging. Other than the lack of feeling any real or long term emotion since I was 17, my other mental problems such as my OCD has gotten much worse and now I’ve developed IBS which has been really stressful/embarrassing.

I don’t feel anything for my friends. My entire life I’ve felt like an outcast and too different to hold any real connection with anyone. I’ve always had friends but I kept them around for social reasons and to have someone to play/vent/talk with. However, I don’t let anyone know my deeper problems. Partly because of the obvious discomfort I would cause them and knowing they couldn’t help me. I’ve never received a piece of advice from a family or friend that helped me. Someone saying they loved or cared for me does nothing for me. Saying it gets better does nothing for me. I don’t expect them to help, I know people’s feelings can be very difficult. I don’t expect to meet anyone who makes me feel any connection, so I always keep to myself.

I don’t think I’m the type to get help from a therapist. For the OCD perhaps, but for the bitter feelings inside me I feel as though I can only help myself or continue to live with them. I was raised to keep these problems inside of me and I can’t imagine myself ever opening up to a therapist. I feel like people throw therapy around as a cure-all but I don’t feel like any other person could help me with these feelings at all. For now all I can do is vent.

This past year I’ve been letting myself go hungry or cold as a reminder of the pain of living. Occasionally I beat myself in anger. I have fantasies of fading into nothing. I stay up til 5 am never doing anything productive.

My family heard me cry and gave me talks that did nothing for me. I simply kept my head down and said nothing. They assumed someone did or said something to hurt me. What hurts me is that my little brother likely heard it all. I’ve always tried to keep my cool because I know he looks up to me. I guess he knows I’m broken now. Another thing I can’t fix.

I some times legit think that I'm cursed. I'm not being over dramatic when I say this. It's just literally everything that I've ever tried ends in utter failure. It's like even when I have this grandiose plan in my head and it looks feasible, when it comes time to execute it all falls apart due to my own over thinking mind set, certain circumstantial factors that I can't control and etc. My life is literal hell on earth and I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing that I'm not suicidal. (only because I'm too much of a coward to even attempt it) At this point, it's either accept it or grovel in my own misery and I can't seem to grasp either options but it's not a healthy mindset to have when you feel like you don't have any other options.

You think everything is just so happy. You ask your parents for something, and you get it. Or, you don't, and you complain about it. You never really grasp what's happening behind the scenes. 


And then, without you even realizing it, you grow up. Everything just.. changes. There was a moment, when we were all children, where we were truly happy for the last time. And we didn't even know. 


Thinking back, I miss those days dearly. But despite how much we will it, we can't wake up. There are theories of being in a simulation, that this world isn't real, or that we're all useless specks of dust flying through space. And I wish they were all true. But I can't wake up. I can't reinvent myself. And it's still important to me. 


When I think back on the people I've hurt and what I've done, I want nothing more than to reach out to them and apologize. Beg for their forgiveness and go back to what things were. But even reaching out, that does even more damage. It's best just to let it.. die. And that, in itself, is depressing. These people used to make me so happy, and I've cut ties so hard, that I can't even let them know how much remorse I carry about how much I've hurt them. It's such a terrible feeling. 


I can't even think of a scenario where I could make things right with those people, anymore. But, at the same time, I can't think of a scenario where it stops. There are so many people that depend on me to be who I am, and so many people that look to me to be better. I have nephews, cousins, uncles, aunts.. they all want me to be better. And shouldn't their want be enough? But..it's not. 


Every night it comes to the same story, where my mind is overtaken by the mistakes of the past, and solutions I have in my mind. But none of them would work realistically. I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry, for everything I've done, but it's not enough to be sorry. You can't just be sorry. You need to be.. better. 


That's what drives you, I guess. The idea of being better. But, if you could be better, wouldn't it have already happened?

I met a girl from out of state while vising a friend. We hit it off really well and it looked like she was into me and I was very into her.

After I left we spoke and texted each other daily. Things seemed perfect until she disappeared without an  explanation. A few month later she said that she is going to visit my area (her family lives there) and she would really like to see me. When I saw her she apologized for what she did. She was in a terrible relationship before and she was scared of going through what she's been to. In the next few days a purchased a plane ticket to go see her for Christmas.

I came to visit her for Christmas. We had a great time. She knows a lot of people in that small town and literally half the town knew who I was. She told everyone about me. The night before I was about to leave we got into a giant argument which did not make any sense to me at the time. By the end of the argument I learned that she was angry because she didn't know how to deal with the fact that I was leaving. In the end I felt that the argument was totally worth it and it made me realize how much she actually loves me. 

Since I left we have been texting and talking on the daily basis until just recently.

Now here is where depression comes into play... I'm depressed, lost, scared and insecure. I was in a relationship before that lasted for about 8 years. It involved drugs, cheating, threats of suicide and suicide attempts, physical violence (on her side), me questioning my every move and apologizing for things I should not have to.

I feel like that relationship is affecting my new relationship with that new girl. I'm scared to say something because I feel that everything I say is pointless and stupid. She is a very strong woman and I feel like a broken mess. I'm terrified. I do have a ticket to go see her again very soon but I just can't stop thinking. I'm depressed and insecure and most likely for no reason what so ever.

Our communication has cut down drastically and I feel that it's my fault. I don't know what to say without overthinking and my mind goes blank when I speak to her.

I think all these insecurities and terrible thoughts are the reason for the lack of communication. I'm a mess. I can't stop thinking. I want to have an amazing conversation with her and I would like to spend an hour taking to her but I have nothing say. Well..  I have a lot to say but not when it matters. I don't know what to do. I want her to understand that I'm going through stuff and I will do my best to get past all that but what if it turns out to be a lie and I'll be just as miserable as ever. Maybe there is no hope for me. I do text her more often than she replies and it drives me crazy. That being said I'm not texting her non stop. Just here and there. Also, when she does reply she says she misses me and asks about my day but I can't stop feeling like I'm being overbearing.

Let me know if clarification needed if you've gotten this far haha. Thanks. I'm depressed, lonely, bitter, scared, lonely and angry and sometimes I wonder if the next life will have something better to offer.

There is so much more... Feel free to dm me and I'll spill my guts out to you if you're interested and/or experienced something similar or ask here if you'd like.

There may be a typo here somewhere or something that isn't clear. Let me know where and I'll explain.

(not sure if that kind of trigger would be necessary on this kind of sub but I am new to reddit, forgive me)

I'm so tired. Probably a relateable experience for everyone here.

I feel like the only reason I'm still alive is because if I killed myself it would destroy the lives of a couple of people I love, mainly my SO, who has already lost a spouse several years before he met me.

These people are wonderful and try to help me in any way they can, but my brain doesn't want to accept that as enough. I'm 23 and I haven't not been depressed since I was 14. Medication doesn't work. I don't know what else to do. I'm so tired of waking up every day.

I'm not at any sort of immediate risk, I'm not going to injure myself or do anything of the like. I just feel like I need to vent somewhere. Every few months I get the urge to ruin my relationships so I can just finally get this over with and stop suffering, but I stop myself because I know how it would affect the people I love.

I feel so selfish, and that makes me more depressed. I feel like the love these people show me is a burden because it prevents me from checking out of life permanently. I don't want to be angry at these people, but I often am.

I'm not sure what I even want out of this post. I feel so alone and like things are getting worse by the minute. How do you stop yourself from being resentful of the love people show you? This is all so fucked up. I'm exhausted.

I will just write here because I don't have anyone i can talk to 

I am in my bed, in pain. I hate everything about me. I wish I could change things. I feel bad because everyone around me suffers with me. It is the worst feeling.

I wish i were happy, cheerful and not sick. I wish i had friends I can talk to. It has been months since I went out with people and have fun. When i go out, i feel so lost. It is like I don't belong anywere. I don't want to make people sad and miserable like me so I stopped talking with them. No one will put up with my shit. Everyone has their own problems. Most of the time I imagine situations and gatherings where I am happy and loved. But for most people I am someone disposable. I can't also connect with people anymore. Everyone feels so distant. 

I hate my job. I fucked my career just as everything else. Seeing my friends improving themselves and being passionate, I am jealous. People say social media is fake but I don't even have anything fake to share. No friends, no success, nothing. 

I am married and so sorry for my husband. He could have had a better partner. But he is stuck with me. I can't give him anything. He says he is happy because he is with me but everyone has a limit and I am sure he will give up on me one day. 

I don't have the energy to change things. I have been like this for so long that I forgot who I was. Is this really me? Everything feels so empty. People say that I should find something that would make me happy. I don't know what will make me happy. For years, I tried so hard not to disappoint people or make them happy, I don't know what makes me happy. I could't even make them happy, that is another failure on my side. 

Whenever I open up, i regret instantly. Showing your vulnerabilities to people is scary. They judge you and say ""you don't have anything to be unhappy for, just be happy"" which makes me more sad because i know i don't appreciate things enough. I know i should feel happy that I have things most people don't have. But I want to have a purpose, a reason to live, joy in things. I want to feel excited for something, not just do things to kill time. I want to feel alive. I want to be thankful for who I am and I want to accept and love myself. I just can't. Depression took so many  things from me. My youth, my energy, my sleep, my friends, my health. It is a monster that devours me. But i am so tired to live like this. I am scared that I will feel like this till I die. 50 more years like this. A job I hate, loneliness, physical pain. It is scary and I feel so lonely. I feel like a burden.

Hey Guys I come to you with a special request today.

My best friend Johanne is currently struggling with depression and yesterday she had a very hard day. She was losing her will for life and got suicidal thoughts again. I was able to talk her out of it again so she’s safe again. I told her how happy I am she didn’t do anything bad.  And I told her that that she deserves all the thank in the world because she decided to keep fighting. But she said sadly nobody around her is happy about that except me.

So here’s my request for you to help her:
Please comment “Thank you Johanne” 
I will show her this post later to show more people than just me are happy she’s still alive. 
You’re more than welcome to add more to the comment to cheer her up or even add your own story so we can help each other. 
I’d be so thankful if you can help me out to help her out guys! ❤️

I had to move away from my already unreliable support system for school and had a really hard time finding a new one because of how anxious I get in social settings. I accidentally joined a sorority thinking I might make more friends that way and in the beginning that was true. By the end of first year, I realized most of my so called sisters couldn't care less about me or my well being. Because I was so focused on trying to have this one group like me I didnt make many other friends. After my first year I had a traumatic death of a very close family member and not a single one of them was willing to help me. 

After the death, my grades began to slip. I stopped going to most of my classes and failed more and more tests, labs, and assignments. No one withing either of my support groups noticed any change and if they did, didnt say anything. 

I started this semester off with a 1.85 GPA and I am required to have a 2.0 term (2 semesters) GPA to even be allowed to take anymore classes next year. Because of this I finally gathered the courage to get some professional help. The counselor I went to couldn't help me much because the school doesn't have enough resources for mental health to keep up with the demand. So I ended my last semester with a 0.75 GPA.

Now I'm having panic attacks and breaking down crying at least once a day. I haven't attended any on my classes this semester and I'm drinking or crying myself to sleep most nights.

They say the word “depressed” with so much disgust in their voice and I feel as though I can’t talk to them about how much I am struggling. 

I can’t stop crying and it makes me feel so ashamed. I feel isolated and alone. I couldn’t kill myself but I wish so bad that I could just go to sleep and not wake up.

My apologies, English is not my first language
So... When i was a kid i've always been bullied by a lot of people in the school, because i have speaking and concentration issues, i had no friends, my parents liked to pretend they cared about me but they didn't, and i always felt alone...
I was never a good student, i always skipped classes, i always failed school, and i never saw anybody helping me, not even my parents! 
I barely had any relationships with any girls because i never had my self confidence to talk to anyone, fearing i would get rejected, a target of jokes, and bullied, wich always happened, and i never saw anybody caring, anybody willing to help me, not even the teachers and my family.
I was always alone, everytime, just got out of school and go straight to home, where i could forget my problems easily with music and video games.
Last year my cousin (18 years old) hang himself, with no suicide note, no signs os depression, nothing, nobody knew why, because he was always isolating himself, but he always had a good life, he had tons of friends, his parents cared about him, he had a good relationship with a beautiful girl, and out of nowhere i get a call from my grandma saying my cousin has killed himself, and of course i was shocked when i heard that...
I went to the funeral with my dad, didn't drop a single tear, but next day, it was 100x more painful knowing he wasn't here anymore, i got so sad and i never recovered from that...
In that time i met some people, that eventually became my ""best friends"", life was getting better, i started to go out with them, do a lot of things with them, but when i was sad, feeling bad about myself, instead of helping me, they would just call me stupid and dumb, for no reason at all, wich made me feel worse, i would disappear for some days, forget about it and talk to them again like nothing happened...
And then in the middle of October, i started to talk with a girl, we have already met in the past, but she lived in another city far away from me, so we never had a chance to talk properly.
She sent a private message on my Instagram, we started talking every day, i was felling in love with that girl, she was amazing! So i did a little sacrifice to go see her in a weekend, we went to drink a coffee, we talked normally, and i was felling in love with her! After being sad, being rejected, i finally found some one that cared about me and felt the same as i did!
Everything was going fine, until Christmas came, in my vacations, as my mom begged for me to stay here, i wanted to spend Christmas with her, because i needed to see her, i needed that! And i did. I went to see her, the first couple days were amazing, as she fell asleep in my arms, seeing her face just made me feel the happiest person in the world! 
And then things just started to go wrong, still to this day, i don't know what i did wrong, she just started to step away, isolating herself, acting different, pretending i wasn't there, so i asked if everything was okay, she said she was fine, but i knew it wasn't, because she was posting in her Twitter about wanting to cry, those kind of stuff, as i tried to talk to her, she just kept saying everything was fine! 
Her attitude took all the sleep from me, i couldn't sleep because i couldn't stop thinking about her, fearing the future...
26 of December, she starts to be mean with me, again, not knowing what the hell i did! She tells me she doesn't want to talk to me again, and decided to cut me out of her life!
Her attitude just ruined the last days of the year, and the beginning of this year...
I cameback home, sad, wanting to cry, isolating myself, and no one cared about me!
I was literally crying for help but no one listens to me! 
And the past just starts to come to my head again, 
Bringing back old problems with new ones in my head just made me feel numb, hopeless, alone with no one in my life! 
I always suffered bullying in the past, got rejected and excluded by everyone in my life, and of course my ""friends"" knowing my current situation, they don't say a word to help, the same goes to my parents and my family.
As it couldn't get worse, i get a notification that i'm going to be kicked of school because i'm not having good grades and because i'm 20 years old!
I don't have any graduation, any skills to do anything, i don't have a job, school, friends, girlfriend, any family, and i don't know what to do and no where to go! 
I'm in a point that i stopped worrying about everything, even about myself!
I haven't sleep well for days, haven't eat a good meal for days, i don't have any motivation to get out of the bed and do something, and i can't distract myself from this pain, and i can't stop crying for a second.
I feel like i wanna die, but i don't wanna go to soon, i'm so empty on the inside with no reason to live at all, I don't know if i'm gonna be here in the next months, to be honest, i'm absolutely done with everything...

Looking back, I’ve had issues with depression and anxiety all my life. Neither became serious or intense enough for me to seek help until about ten years ago (I’m in my early 40s). 

Of course, since being diagnosed, I’ve been through the gauntlet of meds and combinations there of. I imagine it’s the same for many people but, for me, they seem to help maybe 10 or 20 percent of the time but that’s about it. 

I’ve been married for a long time and, while we’ve had ups and downs, things have generally been pretty good up until this past year. The digs and jabs at each other just started to get progressively worse along with a steady increase to just fighting in general and....you get the idea. Our fights have never involved violence of any kind until a few weeks ago. It was a bad one and we were both yelling a lot. My wife gets very malicious and cruel when she’s angry. She knows just where the separations are in my “armor” and has no issue with exploiting those
vulnerabilities. She began doing so during this fight a few weeks back and really hit a nerve that caused me to start to cry. I was reduced to the point of sobbing and I asked her for us to just call a halt to the hostilities and talk. I reached out to attempt hugging her and she hit me. Hard. She didn’t hurt me and it hasn’t happened since but she was clearly putting everything she had behind that swat and I never, in a million years, expected it. She never apologized but she hasn’t done it since. 

I’ve been here for a few years and met someone I thought was a kindred spirit in a sub a couple of weeks ago. I should have known better, but we became very close very fast and it felt great to have someone just to talk to that actually made me smile and feel good about myself. After about a week and a half, that all came to a screeching halt. Ghosted. Ghosted, but this is Reddit, so I got to still watch her flirt with and hit on other me.  Lesson learned. It was something that I shouldn’t have been doing in the first place so I brought 100% of that hurt upon myself. Fuck, though, did it (and does it) hurt. 

While there’s been no more boxing, the fighting just continues to intensify at home. Something that is new, though, is that she’s started using my mental health struggles as ammo against me and holding them over my head during our arguments. 

This week, after 20 years of busting my ass for the same company and working my way into a great, extremely well-paying job that I earned and loved, I was downsized. More fuel for the argument fires. 

I can’t. I just can’t. I want to sleep. I want to hide. I want to run away. I want to do whatever I need to do for this feeling to stop. After forty odd years of life, it’s just shown me very quickly and in painful detail, how fucking disposable I am. Ok, universe. Point taken. Now what?

If I pull the rip cord on life, it will destroy my family and the thought of doing that to them makes me sick(er) inside. On the flip side, I can’t face the thought of waking up tomorrow (and the day after that, the day after that, etc.) next to someone who is clearly done with me and will likely remind me of how useless I am before lunch time. 

For those of you that read through all of my drivel, thank you so much. I have no idea what I’m going to do but I know I don’t want to do it. I just needed to get this off of my chest. 

Love to all of you that are out there and struggling. I know that it could be so much worse for me and I wish that I could do something to help each and every one of you that are hurting. ❤️💔😞",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,593167,public,confidence,self,Boxed In,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/esq3v8/boxed_in/,no_ads,0.0

I had a particularly awful bout of depression a few months ago and it sent me spiraling. I had completely checked out of life for that entire time. 

I spend every day alone in my room in my house with nobody around. I pass the time with music. After I started feeling better, I felt like I was lagged behind the world for years. It kind of felt like I was in a bunker and just got out after a messed up nuclear war or something.

The time away I disappeared from the few friends I had. They welcomed me back with ‘open’ arms for a while and were being nice to me. They were happy to see me I guess and they missed me.

But here lies the problem: me. I don’t think I’m the same person anymore. I just don’t mesh well with how they are and I just don’t think they like me anymore. The issue is they are in my community of musicians and I can’t really avoid them without a particularly bad fight where I would have to kick them out or leave the group entirely... for ‘treating me differently’ which just wouldn’t work and I would seem like an awful person for doing it... 

But it’s true though, I think they just don’t care for me. They don’t seem to invite me to anything they are doing and they avoid talking about any of the stuff they do. They are acting like they are walking on eggshells around me and tbh I feel the same way towards them.

Not only this but I just don’t even know how to act anymore. I seriously don’t even know who ‘I’ am anymore. I have always aired my frustrations with depression and anxiety and stuff out in the open cuz I feel like I have nothing to hide - but maybe it’s getting old to everyone involved.

I don’t even know what to post anymore on Instagram. Everything in the world feels so fake. I feel so cynical and empty. I feel like everyone wants something from you or wants you to do something with them all the time or else they will stay away. I hate these feelings. 

I wish I could find a balance with myself again but now I feel permanently altered. I feel anxiety from every single move I make and it strikes me down every time. The panic attacks happen even worse when I am being really kind to people (because I feel like a fricken fake)

I don’t know if I’ll ever understand who I am or was. I am not particularly okay with that. I feel like I lost big pieces of who I am and I’m in amnesia. I hate how plastic I feel.

In my country, you’re unable to get a therapist who doesn’t share everything with your parents if you’re under 18.
I, am under 18, and autistic.

I’ve tried to get my parents to get help, they did take me to a psychiatrist, but as my parents left the room, and the psychiatrist said that everything that *i* said, she was gonna forward to *my* parents, that scared me enough to lie to her.

She asked questions like “Do you do any self harm?” And “have you ever thought about ending it?” Which I answered *no* to both, huge mistake.

I now have a social worker that I can’t use for anything besides helping me with the social stuff, and not the mental stuff.

I want to die, I really just want to die.
I’ve been struggling with these thoughts for 4 years, and my first suicide attempt was when I went to the psychiatrist for the first time, all she did was diagnose me with autism.

I thought about taking my life again countless times over the past couple of months, and I tried to confront my mom about it yesterday, all she said was that “I just need to learn how to understand myself”

Yes, because not seeing a future and waking up everyday feeling tired and miserable is “not understanding myself”.

I know that if I told anyone about these thoughts, I’d get sent away, and I can’t let that happen. I really, really can’t.

I’m unable to do school work, hack I’m sitting in the middle of math class right now, the other’s are taking a test, I’m unable to participate, because it’s so unbelievably stressful, and I don’t even know anything about the subject they’re testing us in, because I’ve been unable to concentrate.

I've had it pretty hard the past few years, outside of 10 years of severe physical and psychological domestic abuse, through the past four years I've witnessed my mother die in front of me, had two grandfathers and my sister pass, and just got out of a physically, psychologically, and sexually abusive relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been taking my anti-depressants for a while now, and I don't know if getting out of that 4 and a half year relationship, or the Lexapro or the grace of God or whatever is making me feel this way, but I feel okay. The negative thoughts aren't really here anymore, I don't feel suicidal as much. I don't cry to Videotape and imagine the song set to my funeral.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'm getting back on my feet, but I'm feeling extremely downtrodden, hopeless, and... ashamed of my situation. I went to college for the past 2 and a half years, and I got academically dismissed last semester, which I've come to terms with because my situation was pretty extreme and I had genuine medical illnesses with a documented suicide attempt and I was rushing through something I didn't need to; it was a recipe for disaster. I know they will let me back in and I am working on my application for re-entry, but now that I'm back in the ""real world"", I'm feeling hopeless.

&amp;#x200B;

After the semester ended we took a trip to California to spread my sister's ashes in La Jolla where my mom is resting. I decided to take this ""winter break"" to breathe, collect myself, and deal with the break-up that I was going through at the time (4 and a half years doesn't sound like much, but it was a quarter of my life). In the past month and a half I've lost 10 pounds (not overweight, but put on the freshman 15 - used to lift weights constantly, getting back in shape), and I've been applying for jobs, but I just feel like I'm set back so bad and I'm not going to make it back into society. I had jobs concurrently from December 2016-December 2018, but the past year was so bad that I only worked a shit job during the Summer, in between full course loads. 

I'm not young, but I'm not old, I'm 20 - so these are all entry level jobs. Cashier/Cook, Grocery Stocker, Cinema Worker, and a Captioning Assistant. I'm afraid basically that people are going to look at my resume that I'm submitting and think I'm just some dumb kid not worth their time. I'm afraid that I've wasted so much time that it's just too late for me and they'll think ""oh, this is just some dumb college kid, let him go into debt and work at McDonald's"". I'm just terrified of the thought of all this time being wasted and my worth being nothing, everything having gone to waste these past few years to the point of no return. I want to go up where I see the others climb, and I finally feel like I have that capacity, but I just don't know if it's going to happen. 

For an example of how I'm feeling... this girl I'm seeing manages this place (entry level position, both her job and the one I applied for \[GameStop\]). I have a lot of money from inheritance, I'm not going to disclose how much but it's enough for me to live comfortably for probably 10 or so years, but I feel like a fucking loser ass bum because of the fact that I fucked up in school and I don't have a job and if I get the job here she's going to be managing me. 

I don't know how to describe this other than... I finally hit the surface, but everyone else is in a boat. Or, I fall from a burning plane into the ocean, and I'm on the wing, floating to an island, hopeful... and I just get eaten by sharks.

I was diagnosed with depression 4 years ago and have been in prozac ever since, my only relapses were the two times I tried to quit my prozac before deciding to continue taking it indefinitely. I recently went to see my doctor for two things: chronic migraines as well as a chronic fatigue-like illness that has caused extreme fatigue, oversleeping (to the point where i began sleeping 12-14 hours a night), low appetite and no motivation because I’m too damn tired to do anything. The combination of these issues has become so severe that I dropped out of school to focus on my health. Seeing that most of my symptoms were physical I thought I had a physical health problem, yet all my lab work showed I was “healthy”.

My doc was looking at my chart and asked if I’ve been feeling depressed or suicidal, I said no. She asked if there are things that bring me joy at home/in life. There aren’t. In fact, ever since this illness started, I pretty much gave up every hobby I had, thinking I was too tired. My doctor points out to me that I have nearly every symptom of depression besides a depressed mood. I’m depressed! It clicks in my brain that I feel (physically) exactly how I felt before I started therapy and prozac, but without the depressed mood I didn’t make the connection. She explains people can get a tolerance to their antidepressant over time and that I have been on mine for a long while without going to a higher dose. Even though I don’t feel better yet it feels good to know what’s wrong, and that it’s an illness I’ve fought before and won every time.

I am trying elavil for migraines, which happens to be an antidepressant as well, so it *fingers crossed* could be a win-win. Even if it isn’t, a common side effect is increased appetite and weight gain which would help me out too. I have a follow up in 2 months so I can give elavil a fair try, then reevaluate how it’s working for migraines and depression and maybe go up on my prozac.

I’d say my struggles with depression started with a girl I dated my freshman year of high school. I started dating her in either grade just before summer but being 8th graders and not living down the street from each other I only saw her once the whole summer. When we got back to school I dated her for a few more month (almost 8 total) before she cheated on me with my (then) best friend and left me for him before she dumped him the next week and became just a completely different person. Because of thing that were said by her I couldn’t help but feel like it was my fault, I did not take her out on many dates because any dates would involve parents and them driving/supervising etc. But the switch was so immediate. One day I thought we were totally in love and the next she is telling me she hasn’t loved me for months and is with my best friend now. I never learned what really happened, I have a feeling she had been cheating on me for a while with more than just my best friend and because I was not in the same social circles as her she was hiding it. After the break up some of her friends were in marching band with me and I was friends with them and they always seemed to not approve of how she treated me, which only makes me feel worse because they know something that she did that I will never find out. Idk. 
  Then from there I never really had anyone to talk to, I had no best friend, no girl friend, nothing. I was struggling in school because (frankly) I am addicted to video games. I also do not find school (especially high school) challenging, just tedious and time consuming. My parents were constantly restricting me and putting controls on me to try to get me to do homework but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it, whether or not video games were present. This put a lot of stress on me because I was also very upset I kept putting my schoolwork off and digging a hole for myself to claw out of at the end of every semester. Because the work was easy, I just wasn’t doing it, and that’s stupid. On top of that it’s embarrassing.
  One day the final straw was something stupid like my dad insisting I cut the grass at this very moment instead of first thing in the morning. I was very upset from some other shit going on too probably and I ran away. I walked to a subway and texted my section group chat that I was alone and crying in a subway and may need a place to spend the night. I end up eating cake at this girls house (she’s like the big sister I needed right then) with her and her mom until my dad came and picked me up once I they convinced me to tell him where I was. All I remember from what my parents said about it was “You could have ruined our reputation in the neighborhood and with our friends” and they told me they would look into a therapist(but they didn’t get one)
  I really needed to talk to someone, desperately, I really couldn’t keep my feelings bottled. I couldn’t sleep. There was a girl(call her M) I sat next to in one of my classes. Beautiful and kind-hearted(actually a friend of my ex, but that didn’t come up often. And also in marching band with me, however a different section). I had become friends with her and I had no other friends my friends in my section could not take anything seriously and avoided any serious talk like the plague(it drove me insane). So I texted her, we started texting as friends for a while, having long conversation over text until it was time to sleep. But then I had one of those nights where I couldn’t sleep. And I confided in her, she tried to relate and would say the usual ‘I’m not qualified’ (which is not a bad thing). I told her I just needed someone to listen, no advice, and she did. She only responded with enough to make me feel heard.
  I can’t remember if there was a reason why, I think maybe I had started picking up through this girl that there had been a lot more going on with my ex than I had previously known. And my depression got way worse, really quick, maybe it was the fact I had someone to listen now caused me to just think about it more. I fell in love with this girl (I hate myself for putting her through this, she was really an angel). I asked her out, she said no, I then confessed my love to her over text. The only reason I can think why she didn’t just stop texting me at this point was because she was scared of what it would do to me. Needless to say my depression got worse and I was now expressing suicidal thought to her. I think I just wanted to hear that someone would care. But I had this other ‘delusion’ that I would somehow hurt this girl emotionally, the way my ex did to me. And I told her that I was ‘scared I would hurt myself or someone else’. A poor choice of words. She did not text me after that night. 
  The next day was a band trip, the trip was several days long and this girl was on it too, but I dared not talk to her. But it was driving me mad and my suicidal thoughts and this overwhelming desire to just end it was strong. I was crying for help. There was another girl I knew(call her S cause too many people now), an older sister of one of my friends and my good friends girlfriend. I looked up to her like a big sister just like the cake girl from when I ran away. S was kind hearted and was the only other person I could think of who always listened when I spoke, and had even stood up for me when I often could not get a word in in a conversation. I wrote down a long note trying to convey just how much I felt like dying, but the action of showing her the note was saying I wanted help. She read the whole note silently and looked at me with genuine concern and even held my hand when she realized I was shaking. S told her younger sister(my friend who was my age) and they both just made me feel better during the rest of that trip. Not once did they offer advice or mention it or ask about it. The one thing I remember is when I was walking alone and they both joined me, even if they looked at me a little different when they asked me how I was. I felt like someone cared. And I want to say my mood was actually improving for the first time in a while.
  But when I got home finally I found out why M was not texting me back. I got home and my parents were upset and told me I was expelled unless I got the OK from a therapist that I was of no threat to anyone. M had told her parents, who had taken screenshots of everything I had ever said to M and brought it to the school, my parents were also very upset I had not come to them to talk to them about these feelings. (Never in a million years would I talk to my parents about my feelings like this. Idk why, I just really can’t. I guess I’m afraid of them trying to fix it by trying to change and control how I live my life) This forced my parents to get me a therapist. The therapist cleared me to go back to school in the first session. But I was not to talk to M, S or her sister ever again, and I didn’t,did not even try for the remaining 2.5 years of high school. Still it felt like losing a best friend with M, even more so because I had no idea if she hated me, was scared of me, or if she was just told the same thing by her parents. And I had felt like S and her sister were really going to be supportive, without the mistakes I had made with M. But now I did not even make eye contact with them. And I had no idea what they were told about me, do they think I’m dangerous? Are they scared of me? Do they hate me?
  I tried opening up to the therapist but it was an hour a week and the sessions ended after like 6 weeks cause they weren’t helping and I was on medication now (that wasn’t helping, for the rest of high school I tried 4 meds none of which had any affect.
  My new mind set was to just keep my head down and be normal, high school will be over soon. I ended up with no real friends and in my senior year I became obsessed with try to make sure I wouldn’t make the same mistakes in college. I literally begged my ‘friends’ in my section in band to tell me what was wrong with me, why they didn’t like me, why was I an outcast while they were all friends and hung out and had these social lives and made everything look so easy. One of them made fun of me, I kicked him from the group chat because I was trying to have a serious conversation and was so sick of them ‘memeing’ everything. The conversation just turned to ‘why tf did you kick him?!’ And I got into a fight with one guy in dms and we actually settled it and he wished me best of luck in sorting out my mental health “but just not here”. 
  I miraculously got a scholarship to a good out of state school for my ACT score of 34 despite my 2.7 gpa.
  I joined the esports club my first semester and played on a team, but when I failed 2 classes I had to leave the computer at home. I hated myself, I was missing out on a social life because I couldn’t balance it and couldn’t make myself do homework again. But I got elected into a leadership position in the esports club.
  I failed English again my second semester and lost my scholarships. But I loved the esports club, it was my passion, even if I couldn’t play on a team anymore. And because I couldn’t play on a team anymore I was losing those friends I made playing and was having lots of trouble maintaining any friendships, again, I really didn’t have any, no one I hung out with. After that summer I spent so long putting off looking into student loans I just took the first semester back off and managed to get a student loan for the next semester ($11,000).
  That brings us to now. The leadership for the esports club is in two broads, an upper and a lower. I was in the lower and have done a lot for the club. And I wanted to move to the upper board this year because the lower board doesn’t do a whole lot and I really wanted to get more involved. So I ran for it, but despite me trying to convince all my friends from the team I played on to come to the meeting to vote, despite how very clear I made it that this meant the world to me. None of them showed. I had the backing of the current upper board and part of the lower board but that was only ~7-8 votes. So of course this guy who has not been on either board jumps in with the backing of every player from his game who actually came out to supported him just leap frogged me from no board to upper board while I will now more than likely never get the chance to be on the upper board and will only get to be in this one lower board seat that really does nothing. Not to mention in my English class I have been failing to write this essay because it is supposed to be about an experience I’ve learned from and all I can think about is highschool which is getting me major depressed. Now failing to turn in the rough draft is getting me mad and depressed and this election failure is just the massive shit on top. I now can not sleep, and am missing classes because of it. There is just no way out. I don’t know what to do. I have no friends to turn to, not that I would, because I learned my lesson about that. I apparently have to keep my emotions all bottled and there is one acceptable way to feel about things. Like I can’t express that I’m upset about losing the upper board seat. It’s fucking bullshit. I’m mad. I have the experience, I love this club. But those fuckers can’t even get off their asses for one night just to vote in a stupid election that obviously means the world to me. It’s hard to not want to push them away. Are they even friends?

I had ambitions and dreams just a few years ago. They called me gifted in high school, I graduated with excellent marks and was selected by the law school of my favourite university immediately.

That's all gone now. All I'd do is fail class after class, I hated every second of it and had zero motivation to learn any of that bullcrap. But of course I was way to stubborn to just accept I wasn't made to become a lawyer, kept on struggeling for 4 years and wasted that part of my life without even receiving a degree for it.

Meanwhile my social circle started desintegrating, everyone except a few moved away, and maintaining friendships on whatsapp proved to be impossible (at least for me).

As things started to get unbearable, I tried to weaponize my self-hatred. It worked for a while, I lost 25 kg and forced myself into a healthier lifestyle. The few friends I've got left would tell me how proud they were...it did nothing for me. On the inside I am still the same socially awkward fat fuck who can't get anything of significance done in his life.

Fine, I thought to myself, if you can't chew what you've bitten off, set the bar lower for yourself. So I dropped out of that fucking law school and enrolled at the history and english departments of my university to become a teacher. 

New studies, new me? Yeah naw, fuck that.
Guess what, yours truely can't even get that done. Exam season is approaching, I'm having panic attacks and am already chasing deadlines before all of it even started properly.

On top of all that, I still don't know anybody. It's been almost 4 months with my new classes, and I still wasn't able to build even one meaningful relationship. Like, not even on a strictly study-focused classmate kind of level. Some days I go to the uni to attend the lectures, of course no one ever sits down beside me, then the day comes to an end, and the only three words I have spoken till that point are the mechanical greetings I uttered to the cashier at the uni cafeteria to get my damn espresso in the morning.
I feel like a ghost haunting the campus.

When I think about it, I haven't been able to establish a single meaningful relationship with a stranger in 6 years. That circle of 5 close friends I hang out with regularly? Yeah, wouldn't have met a single one of them if my bench neighbour in high school hadn't become my best friend and hadn't set me up with the rest.

My love life? Don't even get me started on that, I am 23 years old, still virgin, and expect to die alone at this point. I struggeld with porn addiction fir a while to cope with that. Got that sorted out I think. Shoutout to r/pornfree .  The emptyness I tried to fill in still remains.

I tried to become an outgoing person, seriously. i had some great nights out at concerts, festivals and pubs and the likes with the friends mentioned above. But even when I stepped out of my shell for once and started enjoying myself in public from time to time, I'd find myself talking with the same friends all night again.

What's worse, I might even have fucked up that part of my life now.
I caught myself developing feelings towards one of my besties of 4 years recently, and decided to confess to her. She's been ghosting me ever since (well, 4 days), and who knows what she told the others so I might just get locked out of there aswell.

My parents? Forget about them. They don't get me at all. When I tell them I just need a moment for myself, they will just yell at me because of my study results. Yeah I still live at home. And they won't shut up about how I've changed since graduating and how they wanted that happy lid back. Bitch, I've been trying to kill that fat nerdy loner for 3 years now, don't you dare to conpare me to him!

Emotional breakdowns have become regular occurences at this point. I was able to keep them to myself this far, happening at night when I am alone with my thoughts, but now they start moving into my professional life.
And now I am sitting here in my university's rest room, locked in my cubicle and sobbing like a 3-year-old in broad daylight while venting on random strangers on the internet. What am I even doing with my life?

I tried talking about this with my friends. I think they can't or don't want to quite grasp the full scope of my problems. All they'd tell me is how I'll find someone, how I am a likeable person and how I should just start talking to my classmates. Ti whom exactly if it feels like everyone is actively trying to avoid me.

About my shitty childhood and alcoholic parents, about my drug use, about all the shit that goes through my head. Now they have everything on paper, it's not my secret anymore, I can't fake being a functioning member of society anymore. I'm scared out of my mind that I shouldn't have told it all, that it will come back at me someday when I'm trying to find a job or get insurance. I'm scared she will tell the cops.

Plus, I won't be able to finish my degree like that. I will have to tell the staff at the University what a broken piece of shit I am in order to not get kicked out before I can finish my thesis. I'm scared they won't believe me. Just like the psychologist probably didn't believe me. I am too much of a coward to kill myself, I still have days where I feel good, so it can't be that bad, can it?

I hate myself for being so weak. I've always been able to handle every fucking shit life would throw at me, every god damn shit person who abused me and took advantage of me. But now I don't even have the strength to get out of bed most time. I'm done. I hate this shitty world and I am convinced that I've made a mistake. People WILL discriminate against me because of that. I know we have laws against doctors telling someone stuff like that but that doesn't mean shit. Health insurers, authorities etc. will get the information anyway. I won't get certain insurance or it will be expensive as fuck, cops will always be out there to get me. I've ruined my life.

They can tell me that they see me the same and like me as a person however much they want but I KNOW it's not true, I know they're lying in order not to hurt me. Or they just don't want to ditch me, as having many friends looks good, they like me being there when they have problems etc. 

Frankly, I don't even believe therapy will help. I don't even want to go just so I can pretend I'm fine afterwards. Fuck that. The problem is not myself, the problem is that the world is shit and most people are shit. No therapy can make that go away.

I am not even sure where or how to properly post this?

For many years I have been trying to deal with this problem. I literally only figured out there is a word for it.... Rumination. I am 50 and I just found out. For years and years I have intrusive terrible thoughts that happen to me multiple times a day and night. If I wake up from sleep at 3am I will inevitably then be kept awake with these thoughts.

I grew up with physical abuse (beatings) and mental/psychological abuse from both parents. My mom was particularly mean. The mental abuse only got worse when I became an adult. Dealing with my mom after my dad died I realized just how much she lies and manipulates me to get control and her way. Even though I fought against her treatment I never successfully stopped talking to her or really disconnected till the last few recent years.

 I will get random thoughts that my brain obsesses with from all through the years. It's not just my childhood. My ruminating can be recent negative things that might have happened.

I noticed that my rumination problem became terrible right after I got married and had a baby in my 30's. Since then I've tried so hard, but my poor husband has had to deal with the fallout. If something happens to upset me today, it's like a chain reaction, I don't just focus on the problem, it's like a chain of bad that connects to make me feel worse.

Example: some jerk might make a rude remark to me. I will replay this in my head, then start thinking if other rude comments from the past, and all of a sudden I am miserable. 

Am I depressed? I didn't think I was? I many times feel like a broken record or I have a faulty brain. A stuck brain. I am a highly functioning person though.

I've moved 17 times now, and I can't find a fucking job that pays a living wage that would allow me to pay my educational debts. I graduated two years ago with a bachelor's in journalism, interned for the army. Tried to move to NYC to be with a girl I was dating. She promptly said I had nothing going for me seeing as I hadn't been offered a job during my job hunt while interning. I left her and restarted out west where I'm from, and lived with my dad while job hunting for six fucking months. Got a job at a small town paper, moved north, and I quit after four months. I made no money (had to go to the food bank), and I was the only reporter for the whole paper. There were no women my age, so no sex, no dates, no guys even my age just to be friends with. My landlord was a convicted sex offender who had raped both of his daughters. All in all the place was a shithole. Went to the mountains for 5 days and slept in a tent/car before hitting a town. Got an internship with a nice documentary company and worked as a bouncer a few nights a week and managed to find an apartment. Finished the internship, but no positions available. I freaked out for a while. Got desperate. Interviewed for a job washing windows. The guy interviewing me had a friend who has a successful YouTube channel (I won't say which one), so he passed my resume along. Got hired for a six month editing contract on the show. Contract ended in December. I still can't get hired anywhere and I still haven't made enough money to start paying my student loans(25g). I haven't worked in nearly two months. I haven't gotten fucking laid since September which is just lowering my stress tolerance in general and just chips at the ol' self esteem.
V I'm trying to shoot a documentary these next few months, and the only paying gig I have lined up is some dog sitting and maybe some logo designs(pocket change). 
 Every night I feel like a complete fuck up and failure. I send out resumes and write cover letters and find myself just waiting for responses that never come. I feel worthless and skilless. When I was a reporter in that garbage town, I applied for peace corps and made it super far until I admitted to having depression in college. I was set to go made it past the interview, had accepted an invitation, and i was getting my Visas in order when I got the message I couldn't join last minute. Seeing as I can't even serve in the fucking Peace corps or get a legitimate job where I'm not just scraping by while my debt piles up, the option of just putting a 9mm through my temple feels more and more legitimate. I fucking look in the mirror and I hate who I see. I detest this fuck up who can't make any goddamn headway. My debt is also entirely federal, and I have confirmed with my loan holders that if I pass away, my family will not be responsible for paying it. I have good days, but at night I remember that I don't have a real job. I remember that all my old friends from school are doing better than me. And it doesn't make me pitty myself. It makes me hate myself. My family all says I'm trying and they believe in me and yadda fucking ya. But I know they think I'm a failure in their heart of hearts. IDK if I would be able to tell the truth to my son if he was failing as much as me, so I get it. The only thing that usually stops me is the idea that I'll really upset my mom if I end my own life. But man I have days where I just want to do my favorite hike, reach the peak, take a look at the mountain goats, send a final email to my family and friends and then just blast my brains out.

Ever done group therapy with 20 other people? I have!

Anyway, I see an individual counselor. Everyone keeps saying I need a medication adjustment but trying new medication really scares me. Lamictal has worked well up until last year but they say I’m maxed out at 200 mg/day. 

I have had terrible experiences trying new psych drugs. Zoloft gave me terrible hives. Wellbutrin gives me hypomania. Last year a psych NP gave me a new drug to try (can’t remember the name) but once I got home and checked my health insurance I realized it was unaffordable ($300+ a month) and the samples she gave me were 2 years expired! I tried another new drug last fall and it was terrible, I was so drowsy I couldn’t drive or think, and i was sobbing and emotionally all over the place on it. The nurse told me to stop taking it after 4 days. I’ve tried Abilify twice but it made me very jittery. 

Everyone is still pushing me to try new meds but I’m scared. What advice do you all have for this? Like how to handle these trial periods of new drugs? My moods are completely unstable right now to the point that I can’t do any of the self-care crap everyone always advises because my body hurts, I can’t sleep, and I can barely work.

I remember the last two years of school thinking that all my friends secretly hated me. I became extremely isolated and reserved. 2013 can only be described as lonely. I spent every day crying, wondering if I ever even had friends. My Facebook was deactivated more often than not, and has been almost permanently deactivated since 2015.

Whenever I catch my self thinking about my high school days, I have to force myself to stop before I spiral even deeper. I think back on what I looked liked, how I acted, and reliving the embarrassment is painful. I think to myself no wonder everybody hated me. I'm angry at myself for not being more self aware. It makes me hate myself even more. 

This week I've been unable to stop reliving every horrible memory.

I started thinking about Facebook. I was trying to remember what photos I had posted of myself, how bad I must have looked. How cringy I must have sounded. I logged back in to take a look, ready to hate myself even further, validate my feelings towards myself.

And it did, but not in the way I was expecting. My photos were the best I've ever looked, decent amount of likes, with some compliments underneath. My inbox was full of memories, messages from people I had hung out with. I was in multiple group chats! How did I forget! Even invited to a few parties. I had a message from someone I lost touch with prior, telling they missed me.

And during that time, I had felt so alone. I isolated myself because I thought everyone hated me. I've spent the last few years heartbroken that no one kept in touch with me, despite me never reaching out, and deactivating all my accounts with no way for them to contact me. I remember crying so hard one night when I found out I wasn't invited to one of my friends school plays. He had never asked me to come. I thought that validated the fact that he hated me. I just read now, 7 years later, that it was mentioned in the group chat I was apart of but never participated in. No he didn't ask me personally, but rereading it now with a clearer mind, I was apart of the open invitation.

I had so many friends, and had never felt to lonely. They were right there, but my depression wouldn't let me believe it. 

The only consolation is that, atleast I know they didn't hate me. I mean, maybe that did by the end of it. I must have come across as a gigantic dick. But somehow it feels better to know that my loneliness is self sabotaged, and not because they all secretly despised me. The only thing wrong with me is my brain. Perhaps I'm not as disgusting and unlovable as I thought. Maybe there is hope.

I'm 17 turning 18 in April. I've been sad for a long time but not until recently did I realize how detached from reality I am.  I'll give you a bit of backstory. I dropped out of school when i was 14 because I severely hate human interaction and my appearance. I leave my house as little as possible, maybe once of or twice a week to work a shift at my shitty job that gives me no hours. I can only really leave my room room until 5pm because my stepmom doesn't like me and makes it very apparent (dad and grandma ask me to stay in my room since we live in a 2 bed apt and its hard not to run into each other). I usually end up playing league until 7-8am and sleep until 4pm. Miss my meds, not be able to leave my room because of my step mom. Repeat. Its a miserable cycle and im constantly uncomfortable in my own home. All my friends are mainly online but I have 1 irl. Sometimes it takes me a week to convince myself to shower or brush my teeth or hair. The only motivation i have to get out of bed and onto my pc is my friends and league. So, I feel like my family hates my existence and that im starting to go bat shit after spending 4 years stuck in my room. I'm not good at talking about my feelings to my friends so thats kinda why im turning to posting here. I just need some advice or just someone that understands and wont judge me? I'm kinda just at a point where i don't know what to do anymore.

But instead worser? Before I was able to think of things to do everyday and keep myself from feeling depressed 
(I haven’t been diagnosed with it), but for the past 2 days of being in this hell hole country I haven’t ate or gotten up from my bed, I’ve gone completely shut down and have been crying once every 2 hours just in the middle of watching Netflix or YouTube on my phone. 
  I miss my sisters my brother my aunts and uncles nephews and nieces, I don’t have family where I live and it pains me so much to have family dinners and events every holiday. Back at home It’s just me, my dad and my mom and dog. 
  I just moved to this country 4 and a half years ago and tried going to school here for a year and left because they weren’t teaching English as well as we thought considering we payed a couple thousand for it. So everytime people would ask “ what’s your school situation “ I’d respond with “ I do online school “ because I did for a couple months actually, but stopped bc it was a free program and it didn’t feel reliable. 
  Another reason why I’m feeling like this is because I just got out of a traumatic experience with my parents, I don’t feel safe coming back home at all. I had a moment where I started to hyperventilate and barely fainted. 
  In conclusion I need ideas and I need help on picking myself back up. I turn 16 this year and I can’t stay here for any longer, I’ve been waiting for too long to go back to America for my dad to just say “ next year “ for the 4th time. 
  There’s a bit more to this but I’m too tired and drained to continue.

When I was in high school, it got worse, and then better the last year of high school and first year and a bit of college after starting in medication (trintellix) and lowering my workload. I got good grades, joined clubs, and was pretty okay, despite having rough days. Now, I’m in my third year of uni, studying what I love, and yet I’m struggling so hard. I can barely get out of bed some days and the only reason I do is for my dog. My meds weren’t working anymore and I was falling behind in class and getting poor grades.

Over Christmas break, I had a pretty bad relaspe, even by my standards. I convinced my mom to let me stay home for a week longer than break, and then a week after that. I hated that I was having to do that, so I spoke to my GP about all this and he prescribed me new meds (Wellbutrin along with the trintellix). I’ve only been taking them for less than a week, but man do I feel agitated (this was par for the course when I first started taking antidepressants). The same day I got my new prescription, I had a terrible panic attack and slipped back into some... harmful behaviours in an attempt to regain control. 

That really shook me and now I’m depressed and terrified to go back to school, both because I am worried about being in a bad place mentally and having so support system and because I’ve now missed three weeks of school and am terrified that I won’t be able to catch up. Of course that then set off my anxiety that I’ll be a failure if I don’t go back and a disappointment to my mum. 

I’m planning to go back on Friday, since that’s when my mom is going on a business trip and my dad will be having to mind my sister (he and I have a shit relationship, to say the least). However, as the idea of going back looms, I get more scared. I broke down crying on Monday when I tried to go back. I don’t want to take a semester off because I’ve already paid for residence and the like, but I’m freaked that I’m gonna send my gpa down the toilet.

Of course he started to get mad after a while. The thing is I have a huge problem talking about my depression and I'm not even sure if he would understand.

doing same job without any clue why he is doing it.
U all are thinking ""what should i with my life""
But when u think about doing something then this thought provoke u that ""it will not make any differences"".
It will.
A piece of paper with weird symbols run this entire world(money) and you think ur works will not make any differences.
U all are not depress but cowards.
A coward who don't want to make sacrifices or choice.
U have to choose between watching movies all day or doing something productive.
U cannot get result in one day, so don't be hasty. Be patience.
  people are talking about taking their life like it is nothing.
Why? Because you think everyone is better than u and u r worthless??
Is this is ur excuse??
Go to history and see how a small army destroyed the massive army and also in modern era how a single man changed the world (reason was their high spirit and optimistic mindset) but i know u won't research any of these because u want to change ur life by sleeping and crying.
----consuming to much information about world had led u into analysis-paralysis (that u can't do anything about this world)


---also go learn about philosophy of stoicism (it may help u)

--be optimistic even world fall upside down
--take decisions and make plans

And what I have been using since I was a kid to try to help make me feel better is feel-good escapism in the forms of movies and shows.

And even when they don't, the representation is poorly handled.

&amp;#x200B;

I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character I've seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtube-exclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesn't exist within these genres.

&amp;#x200B;

But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers: Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose.

I cannot go to a psychologist because I am a part-time monster; I cannot share my deepest thoughts because it is uncomfortable to see the hate in their eyes. And I don’t believe in the effectiveness of shrinks anyway; they are mind whores who will listen to you in return for money and give you trite advice from a coockbook that changes every 5 years anyway (remember when being gay was a disease?).

I am only somewhat above average intelligence but highly obsessive. The latter allows me to focus on a certain project or goal with a lot of energy, which allowed me to get a PhD in a STEM field and transition from bullied asocial nerd to seemingly successful man. But I have become highly bored with my field once I have learnt the routines I am trapped at given my only somewhat average intelligence. I have started obsessing over other things, sometimes extremely trivial and random like decorating my house or learning how to add darts to a shirt or how to improve the acoustics of a room.

I used to consider myself a humanist but now I see that I hate people. I can only love a select number of people. I don’t care about the well-being of an abstract plural mass of people. I also suspect that many people don’t care either but just pretend to care to gain social acceptance.

I have a very sweet girlfriend who is perfect in many regards (she doesn’t know how to lie and sometimes I have to remind myself how lucky I am of having her). She is less intelligent than me and there are some conversational topics I cannot broach with her because she won’t follow, but in many regards she is morally a better person than I am. I was a victim of bullying and overzealous parenting and probably some congenital issues in my head (as opposed to most progressives today, I don’t think everything is environmental), and I have evolved into a twisted individual with severely masochistic and sadistic tendencies (formerly mostly masochistic, nowadays the sadistic ones are predominant). I have become addicted to roleplaying these fantasies on the Internet with strangers, activity that sucks way too much time of my life.

My relationship with my girlfriend is of a kind that will offend most people nowadays, especially in the hyper-progressive country I live in. Since I am more intelligent and experienced, I lead the relationship. I invest a lot of time teaching her new things and helping her, but I “collect” my reward imposing my criterion on most regards, including our sex life. Hate me but I think it is a fair arrangement, it was a very normal one a few decades ago, where I would actually be called a pussy in many regards. I also genuinely care for her and I don’t pressure when I see that something is a hard limit for her, and I like making her happy to the extent that is compatible with my own desires. There are things I have pressured her into and for which I would be called an absolute monster but she has eventually enjoyed. Likewise, I have pressured her to do things using abusive methods but the results have been transforming her from an overweight white trashy girl (good-natured though) to a classy girl that dresses elegantly and follows a healthy lifestyle weating well and doing exercise regularly. Am I a monster or an underpaid life coach? Probably both. Things are more complex than the morals of the spirit of a given time.

I have no friends, and I don’t need to explain why after you are reading this. I found a friend in the Internet for the last year and a half but our relationship has been tortuous because she also has mental issues that make her unable to become a real-life friend despite that we live relatively nearby. Despite enjoying Internet conversations, I need a real-life friend with whom I can have shared experiences, but it has become apparent that she just wants to keep things in the little electronic box undefinitely and it is frustrating for me. It is extremely difficult for me to find other people I can click with. The few people I seem to start clicking with have always had mental issues and that has led to tortuous relationships that ended sourly. Not that being broken is a sufficient condition for clicking, but normal, balanced, correct people are so fucking boring from the very start, and when I pour a bit of the real me they will look at me with a mixture of fear and lack of understanding.

 And yet I feel like its all so precarious. Our money is so so so tight because Im on maternity leave longer than I expected. He won't take a bottle. No matter what we do, we've tried it all. 

And I'm upset because breastfeeding is so conflicting for me. I suffered CSA so its very triggering.
But its also empowering.
Its so frustrating and its so incredible.
But thats all irrelevant because its keeping me from work and we're slipping behind further and further every week.

For years now we have been poor.
I mean, dirt poor. I was never a good earner I work so fucking hard but i never made more than 15 an hour. He makes more now but with two kids and bills and rent, its just never ending. We cant ever seem to get ahead.

I have been working on my mental health for years. I am DEDICATED. I TRY SO FUCKING HARD. I'Ve learned so much but ITS NEVER ENOUGH!!!

We don't get to do anything fun. We never have sitters because we cant afford them. We can't buy nice furniture or nice food or nice cloths, I don't even have fucking underwear because we always need something else a little bit more. 
I'm so disenchanted with life.
I had a good feeling this morning for the first time in I don't know how long. I experienced hope. I was proud of myself.
I woke up at 5am and fed my son and put him.back to sleep then I showered and I meditated and I did yoga and I made tea and had a healthy breakfast. I woke up my oldest with cuddles and smiles and I fed the cat woke up my son and fed him his little breakfast and then I got my oldest to school happily and it felt great. I felt right and cozy in the world and I was proud

And then I went grocery shopping. We had 27 dollars budgeted for food for the week which was okay because we only needed odds and ends to make it to friday but then what I had on the list, which were the bare essentials went the fuck over. I had to leave things. I had to worry about my account being overdrawn. It sucked but I sucked it up.
Then on the drive home, we get pulled over by a cop. I was on a country road, no other cars. We werent hurting anyone. Do to my history, i perceive authority as a threat and in my defense every authority figured has completely and royally fucked me over and nothing ever happens to them. 

I start crying immediately.
This bastard does that patronizing ma'am talk and doesn't care or hear a word I'm saying.
Writes me a ticket anyway. 
I want to tear all of my skin off and die because I was wearing this skin when he fucking humiliated me.
I know I have an authority problem but I swear I would hate cops anyway because THEY DON'T FUCKING HELP. They only make life worse for people with mental issues or drug issues or money issues or minorities at large. They are murdering harassing glorified bullies and Ive only ever been hurt by cops. 

But i want to die today because I am so fucking fed up.
I can try and try and try and I can succeed a little ONLY TO BE DRAGGED BACK DOWN AGAIN BY THIS FUCKING SYSTEM. It truly feels like everything is designed to keep me  poor and struggling and weak and sad. I am tired of it. I am so tired of it.
I do spirituality. I do it every minute. I read and meditate and adjust and try and I am still always just a few months from things getting easier.

Parents had no idea and at the end I barely got through the exams. I tried my best to avoid any school friends after that. I got in to engineering school which I studied telecom. And still I was avoiding every reunions of college pals. Every time the college topic is brought up the incident came haunting back to me. I found love during my studies. And later after graduation got dumped as she was using me to get her secret partner to like her more. That was it. My parents knew about my relationship and I was so sure about it.

I'm a 22 year old college student. I moved here last semester, and its a change of pace where I came from. I used to live out in the middle of nowhere, and now I'm close to everything. There's plenty of things to do, but nothing is enjoyable.

Over a year ago I got tired of being fat and out of shape, lost 75lbs over the course of 6 months and got into body building, and since then have built a decent physique. I'm in the gym 6 days a week, and do muay thai and bjj 4 nights a week. My classes are going fine, I've been in a relationship for a few months now. I go downtown to bars and hangout with people regularly. I'm a CIS major, so I'm big into PC gaming and other things. I play guitar, piano, and I've been writing music again lately. I've no health problems, or any sources of stress really. I work a few hours a week in retail and I get to talk to people about fitness and weight lifting, so its okay. I have plenty of friends I see regularly if that matters I guess? I have nice things, nice PC setup, nice car, nice relationship with family friends and partner. I don't do any drugs aside from the occasional drink at a bar. I'm in great shape physically, and everything is going pretty well for me.

Given all that, why can I not shake this unbearable sense of boredom? I do lots of things, and yet it all feels meaningless. Nothing makes me sad, but nothing makes me happy either. I find no fulfillment in anything, no joy, nothing. It seems like i'm just existing day to day. I can't play any game, play music, or really do anything for more than an hour before I'm just so bored I have to do something else. Tv shows, anime, books, fishing, photography, etc all loose their interest in me after 1-2 hours tops. I don't feel anything except boredom. I suppose the only time I experience any sort of 'enjoyment' is when I'm in the gym. For those 2 hours everyday I actually feel something. I put in my earbuds and blast my music and sweat and toil. But i'm human, and even though I find myself there twice a day sometimes, there's a limit to how much you can workout.

I just want someone to acknowledge me and think I’m special.

Well the one person who did that is now dead, my mom passed away and being alone is harder because I’ve got no one to talk to.  I’m too shy to speak to new people, I’ve done it all to myself.  It’s so much harder than just speaking to people for me but that’s not the reason I’m a waste of life.

I’ve been on the verge of crying everyday for the past week and waking up wishing I didn’t wake up after realizing how sad my life was.  I know it’s fictional, I’m in touch with reality but I’m such a simp that fictional characters having fun, friends and being loved by a girl sounds amazing.

I’ve never been particularly happy but more or less functionally happy enough that I can do what I need to do.  I’ve seen specialist but they’ve never helped and now I’ve been broken by a cartoon to the point I’m confessing to people who do not know me.  I’m an abject failure.

My dad probably things I’m a failure and my mother is probably rolling in her grave wandering how she raised a wimp.  

Friends and loved ones aren’t required for living but having someone to live for sounds amazing, now all I have is love for people that can never be shared because I’m so scared I’d rather die than someone reject or be to me.

I keep a smile, and project an upbeat character to my peers, but I know deep down I'm hiding from traumas I know I cannot cope with in a healthy way.
    I may be bigoted, but in my opinion the only people I hear talking about depression are people who have never lost a single thing, never dealt with a huge crisis, or never hurt someone. These people seem fake to me, it makes me think that if I were to make a Facebook post everyone would view it how I'd view it, as a weak cry for attention, plus it's just nobody else's business. So I'm here in private with a throw away. 
    I'm an 18 year old male, and a senior in high school. I wouldn't call myself a loner, and I am not bullied. I have however not had the best hand dealt to me, which so what many do have, and have had it way worse than I. If I knew specifically what makes me lie compulsively, create elaborate stories, and feel the way I do, I wouldn't be here, but sadly I can't put my finger on it. 
   Throughout my life I've been dealing with harsh things, that most people don't have to even think about. I was molested by my mother's boyfriend's son throughout the duration of my stay in his home. I was four years old at the time, and I think I only went along with it because it was the only time he'd treat me decently. He called it ""playing house"". I have ignored the existence of this trauma my entire life until fairly recently, it made me look back and see the domino effect it had on everything else in my life. I never actually thought it changed me, but anymore I think it's where this traumatic road begins. 
   Skip a few years ahead and I'm in my aunt's basement with my cousin. He was five years older than me, I was probably about six or seven years old. I remember initiating inappropriate behavior, and he going along with it, before being caught by his brother, who when I asked if he'd say anything told me he'd keep it a secret. His brother began touching me every time we hung out. It started out with ""games"" and eventually I just knew what he wanted, so I did it. I remember him trying to get me to watch gay porn with him, I just wasn't into it at all. It turned into him trying to get me to watch child pornography he'd acquired online, still wasn't into it. I remember after years of this type of abuse telling him I was done, and that I didn't wanna do it anymore. I was probably about eleven or twelve. He didn't listen right away, and kinda just forced the situations in a non violent way and would just keep begging. Eventually it did halt. I think I went along with it for so long because he and his brother would smoke weed with me and let me hang out with them and their friends. I felt cool being the only eight year old in my school who smoked weed, and everyone else thought I was a huge druggie
   I still loved him, he was my favorite cousin, and I just tried to look past the sexual side of the relationship. Flash forward to thirteen years old and he dies suddenly his first week of school. Nobody knows if he killed himself or was murdered. This was my first loss, and I didn't take it well. It was around then that I started getting drunk, and high on my own outside of social gatherings. I made everything about him, and thought about him everyday, but I feel like I was just screaming for attention to be very honest. 
   Then my step father, we never really got along too well, I was a very stubborn kid and would always debate everything I could with him. He began dating my mother after she left the previous man whose son was touching me(she didn't know about that, still doesn't). I was about 8 years old and I met this man at my aunt's new year party. I was playing pool in her basement and this cool biker looking guy comes up to me and started showing me all these pool tricks. I thought he was a cool guy, and introduced him to my mother. Next thing I now he starts showing up at our apartment, and starts dating my mother. He was a great man, he got us out of our apartment and into a nice house. We lived together as a family, him being here for me more than my own biological father. They dated for a few years and eventually got married.
  He suffered a major heart attack a few months after their wedding and was in a coma in the Cleveland clinic for months. We were told he was brain dead so many times and we began looking into the last resort. He miraculously started to show brain activity. Eventually becoming his old self. His heart was mostly dead, they had put and LVAD in his chest. They are only supposed to support you for a few years until you can get a heart transplant. He had complication, after complication for the last few years of his life, even losing his leg. Eventually he died. Before he died I stole edibles from him, his daughter made a huge batch and put it in the freezer and I ate some of them. They asked me about it, and I lied. My mother told me while he was on his deathbed to maybe tell him I did it. I remember going in and just saying I love you. He looked weaker than I've ever seen any other person in the world and told me ""If you're honest with me, I'll love you more than you'll ever know."" I just broke down crying writing this part, I should've made things right when I had the chance. Because of me he suffered more in the end. 
   After he died my mother started spiralling. She had already become a functional alcoholic while he was hospitalized and his death didn't help her much. A bout two months after he passed some other shit happened. Me and my biological dads daughters haven't had much to do with each other since we were kids. I lost contact with them for years after they decided to stop seeing him. But as I grew older we began to talk more and more. The oldest one eventually becoming one of the closest people in the world to me. But the younger one had an addiction issue. She started using heroin in college and was off and on with it. I remember our last conversation, we talked on the phone for six hours straight, and she had told me that I should try NA meetings (She was sober at the time) and she'd take me to one the next day. I woke up, skipped school, and waited for her for a few hours. Eventually my cousin showed up, and he told me my sister had overdosed and died. This cousin was the closest person to me in the world at the time, We'll call him J. I punched the post, and screamed fuck. Grabbed my shoes and went to my father's house with him. 
   The funeral was something else, I never got to see her body. My other sister and her mother and her mother's side of the family got to, but not me.   My father flipped out at the viewing and was screaming and kicking doors, after they refused to let him""see his baby girl"" and pour a little Irish whiskey on the casket for ""tradition"". His freakout severed his relationship with his surviving daughter to this day. 
   About six months later, I took a trip to Syracuse NY, and while I was away, J was robbed and killed. They kept him alive until I got back and could visit. I remember handling that funeral better than I handled any other close death. I feel I became numb to it at that point. I had lost three of the closest people to me in under a year. 
   Tensions grew at home for about a year, until last January of 2019. I woke up to a message from my mother's friend stating that my sister had received an alarming suicidal text from my mother. I called my sister and my mother did indeed send her a suicide not basically and left us with no way of knowing where she was. I began thinking on my feet fast. I knew my mother never carried cash, always used her card. I called the bank and asked if they knew where her last transaction was. They told me they would need a subpoena hand delivered by the police, and I didn't have that kind of time. I had my sister call back impersonating her after j found all the right information. They tracked the card to a lodge a few miles away from where she works. We called her co-worker and told her where she was. She got there and my mother was in bed unconscious, three empty pill bottles laying at her side, breathing slowed. She couldn't get her to throw up. The ambulance eventually got her to the hospital where they pumped her stomach. The night before my mother did this, we had an argument that turned real nasty. It was mostly over a car, and how I needed her help to finance it for the first few months until I could. I wanted to stop selling drugs and get a real job, go legit, worry less. This turned into a screaming match, because she had been promising me for months and months. The last words I said to her were you make me wanna die sometimes, and she said well you make me wanna die too. 
   When I showed up at the hospital they allowed my brother and sister back, but not me. It took about an hour before I eventually got to see my mother. When I get there I was in tears, I kept asking if I was the reason and she wouldn't answer me, just looked at me. It was then that I skipped town to live with my dad's daughter. That went great until she realized I saw glamour in the wrong life and wasn't prepared to live my life her way. She cut me out after living there for 6.5 months, and hasn't spoken to me since. I hear she's pregnant with twins now and is having a wedding soon.
   After I was booted I had nowhere else to go, so I came home, something I told my mom Id never do. I eventually grew to the place again, and began to get out everyday. I packed so much shit into a day then, there was just never any time to think about other things. My drug use went from weekly to daily. Mostly just marijuana, which was better than the shit is done the previous years. 
    After a couple of months living like this and being very free I had gotten into a little trouble. I left school early one day for a doctor's appointment. There was weed in my center console, but I hadn't smoked any yet that day. I get gas, and then someone hits into my vehicle. Police show up to fill out an accident report and smell my car. I'm then arrested because it smells like weed and they suspect I'm under the influence based on that alone. They took me for a blood test, little did they know I stuffed 90% of the weed in my pants. I showed up positive for thc because I had used it in the last thirty days, and in PA that's all it takes to get a DUI. My mother kicked me out that night. She told my sisters fiance to do it while she was out. I was watching TV and he came in and told me to ""Pack a bag and get the fuck out!"" ""Where do I go?"" ""Nobody cares."" I was out of my house, no phone, no where to go, just a blue suitcase with a few outfits. Homecoming dance was that night, so all my friends were at the dance and then at after parties, I had no phone, no way of contacting my father. Eventually I ran into this girl who had picked me up due to me being stranded a town over like a week prior. She took me home with her and let me sleep in her bed while she took the couch. I stayed there for a night, and called my dad the next morning. I tried to go home first, but my mother told me to get in the school bus and she'll think about it. To which I just did so. I get home and she's here with my sisters fiance. They tell me that if I'm going to live in this house, he doesn't live here btw, then it's on their terms. The terms were
All of my belongings, even sentimental object will be removed from my room, and thrown away. The only things in my possession would be 3 outfits to finish the school year in, and box springs alone to sleep on. I said fuck it if rather live with my abusive alcoholic drug addict of a father.

Sorry, guys.

I haven't been online in a little bit, but I wanted to throw my words somewhere so I can get them out. After suspicions of having some mental health issues, I went to the doctors office where I was officially diagnosed with clinical depression. 

I'm sure a lot of you guys are familiar with the short ten question form that the doc gives when you check in at the office, and after taking that, I was found to have a lot of 2's and 3's circled (the highest levels of severity on a scale from 0 to 3). I almost cried when my doc said it was ""clear"" that I had depression. 

The conversion was led then for a short while about my history with emotional abuse from a previous relationship. I won't get to far into it, but in short, I had a high school girlfriend who would call me and wake me up at 3 am, crying and losing her mind. I'm assuming she had mental health issues that I didn't have at the time.  She would tell me how she was scared to go into the kitchen because there were knives in there that she could kill herself with, or how she was scared to go into the bathroom where she could drown herself in the tub. 

At this point, being that I've already talked people off of that edge before, I would sneak out of my home and make the 30 minute drive to her place, driving at times over 100 mph to rush to her place. Every time I got there, she would be sound asleep. Every time this happened, when I would ask about what had happened, she would disregard it as if it never happened.

The doc just kindly shook his head through my story, not really commenting on the contents of it rather than just comforting me with positive reassurances, which was nice. He gave me some kind words about how this is something that can be beat, and prescribed me with Celexa, a supposedly more natural anti-depressant compared to others. He also advised that I call the mental health department of the hospital, and begin regular therapy sessions. I have yet to make the call, but I plan on it soon. Still haven't gotten much motivation within myself to call yet.

In all, I'm afraid and excited of this journey that I'm just starting. I'm scared I'm not going to be strong enough to make it through, but I'm going to try to power through. I need to be better again. 

I wanted to thank u/likatika for commenting on my last post about my initial appointment. I woke up with the intention to skip it, but read your comment and gained the motivation to get out of bed and into the shower. I'm eternally grateful. Additionally, the friends who I have, who have also given their kind words, have been a great help as well. I don't know what I would do without them.

I think I want to post more updates as I go through this process. Whether or not I'll make an official schedule for myself or just post when I feel like is undecided. Regardless, I'll be word vomiting my thoughts onto this subreddit when I can. See y'all soon.

I've been told that I'm ""glowing"" a lot lately. That I appear so positive and happy. And until yesterday, I honestly held that as truth. I hadn't yet realized that I had somehow managed to replace sadness with numbness. I forgot I was depressed, if such a thing is possible. I became so used to feeling terrible that I no longer noticed it. I never questioned why I kept forgetting to eat constantly, why I never had the energy to do anything besides lay in bed, why I slept 16 hours a day. I give people automated smiles and participate in small talk, telling them exactly what they want to hear. I felt that if I fake being happy, I'll eventually become happy. I really bought into the whole ""if you try, you can change your life"" shit. Until something in me snapped and I broke down.

It just hit me. I've been totally alone my entire life. Not a single person on this entire godforsaken planet loves me, platonically or otherwise. I'm going to die alone. In fact, if I dropped dead today I doubt anyone would give a sliver of a fuck about it. I'm going to die alone having never accomplished anything. I never finish anything, I don't have any passion anymore. I dropped out of college because I couldn't choose a major and I didn't want to be in crushing debt for something I wasn't even sure I wanted. Everyone else my age seems to have some sort of direction, but not me. I'm just doing everything to survive without any idea as to what sort of career I actually want.

I am living in my own head constantly. My loneliness eats me alive and I exist in a state of decaying stagnation. My eyes are always just barely held open and threatening to collapse, even after 16 hours of sleep a day. I am in a daze, a trance. It's gotten to a point where I just talk to myself out loud. I certainly can't talk to anyone else. I've met a lot of people and I get along with mostly everyone, or at l least, I try to.

The thing is, I don't think I'm capable of genuine human connection outside of superficial small talk. I've gotten close a few times, but it always slips out of my grasp. Friendship is always me trying to talk to someone over text and them never responding for weeks, if at all. Never initiating conversation with me. Never bothering to check up on me. I'm not one of those ""they didn't text me back in five minutes so now I'm angry"" types, so I'm not exaggerating when I say they never respond. For weeks. 

It is for this reason that I currently only have one close friend that I talk to semi-regularly, and I made the mistake of getting attached to them. This person is almost impossible to get in contact with, and only hear from them a few times a month, so when I have something I want to share or a joke I wanted to tell, I pull up our chat and start typing - only to stupidly realize that they'll never respond and that I'd only be annoying them, because they still haven't responded to the last message I sent them weeks ago. That is until they have a problem they need to talk about, but when I need them they're nowhere to be found. A dark part of me wants to lash out and say something passive aggressive because I'm tired of this dynamic in all of my friendships, but I know that won't solve anything. Maybe there's a reason they don't want to talk to me, like they're depressed (the introverted way I suppose) and don't feel like talking. I don't want to force people into talking to me out of guilt even though it hurts to be alone. I feel bad for this, but I have emotional needs too, and it feels like they're never being met. I just want someone I can talk to and hang out with every couple of days, is that so much to ask for?

I don't know. I'm terrified that sooner or later this friend, that I've invested so much time and emotional energy into, will one day stop responding altogether and leave just like everyone else. And above all else, I'm terrified of appearing clingy or overbearing, so I don't say anything at all, I just let it happen and accept my fate. I don't see me friends as expendable, I love each of them and I consider them my family, so when I inevitably lose them it hurts more than I can take. There must be something wrong with me. I hate being an extrovert, I wish I could be happy living a solitary life away from people and their bullshit, but alas...

I don't know how to meet ""real friends"". The months keep going by faster and faster and all I do is live in my own head like a loser, fantasizing about having a group of friends and talking to imaginary ones. No one cares what I have to say, and no one cares about me. I have nothing to offer anyone and I just want out. I'm so tired of everything hurting. It hit me like a train and it feels like my chest is being crushed. There is no way out, even if I try I always fail and end up here.

I like my brother a lot, even though he has his faults. He’s never too bad with me, just annoying and stubborn at times. He’s only 15 though, so it’s to be expected. I wish I could help him more, but I’m not his parents, and he won’t let me, so I leave him alone.

At least I’m going to college next year, but who knows where I’ll get in and where I’ll go. Who knows how much my parents will end up contributing financially. Maybe I’ll have to take loans for a state school even though my parents make a lot of money because they don’t want to spend it on me. I already got into one school; I don’t like it too much, but at least I have somewhere to go.

First of all, I feel like an imposter for even _considering_ posting here at all... but it's anonymous so what the hell. Maybe someone is having a similar situation! (just to state it, I'm not looking for pity, or... help? I'll take help of course! any and all tips and tricks! Just that I'm not _expecting_ there to be much help that could do me any good... like this is something I gotta navigate out of on my own... idk)

I pretty much have everything in order (in terms of what people treasure), a job, some friends, and they're good friends, and the job pays well. I have pretty much all my family members alive and within a small 40 minute commute (for now), so I could visit them anytime, and I do try to visit them 2 times a month or so. I have my own place that I rent while waiting for my new home to be constructed, and that one I've taken on a mortgage for &amp; will actually own. Bizarre. I feel really really bizarre at times, like this is _too_ normal or something. (also, owning your own home is the norm in the country I live in, like 70% do it). Not that I don't mind hiding in the masses either, I don't want to be ""special"" either. But it kinda freaks me out thinking about what I am currently doing at any time. I'll _often_ stare blankly at whatever I'm doing at that time and ask my self ""what am I _doing_?!"". I know I gotta eat and stuff to stay alive, but when I think about something like eating, that too weirds me out.

I can _like_ stuff, but I can never think too much about it either (if that makes any sense). I know that whenever I question stuff I like, i find out that I'm incapable of really enjoying it. It's like I'm looking for something _more_ than just the normal 'like' I have for say, food, games, reading mangas &amp; books, netflix, creating stuff. As if I remember the sensation being more vivid, and now I just kinda want to know if I'm just _missing_ something, like maybe i need to ""find my values"" or something. Maybe it's that the work I do doesn't align with my sense of purpose or... idk... I just can't put my finger on it (if I did I'd be doing it!).

I have wildly ""mood swingy"" moments/days, where some days I feel great, and at others I feel terrible. I'll often flip between being really inspired to do something (having grand ideas), but every time this happens I almost immediately lose all interest, like I'm picturing myself having made/done the thing and going ""and then what?"", or in some way downplay whatever it was. When I'm in the presence of others (usually friends), I'll force myself to stay switched in the ""upbeat and positive"" mode of thinking, since the last thing I want is to pour out any kind of negativity on others. I feel that's extremely unfair, and it's one of the things I really fear becoming. I feel like I've met enough people that seem to just be down &amp; depressive about stuff (even if it's disguised as ""being realistic""... these are some of my friends too, and it makes me want to grab them and shake them and say ""yes I know things are like that! you're grabbing the low-hanging fruit of situational analysis! I'm not trying to be _overly optimistic_, I'm not some _alien creature_, I'm _definitively_ faking it! It's just that I _wish_ I too could mope and gripe about everything, but I'm trying my darn best not too! since that would be giving up, and I do genuinely want things to get better! I want to get to the point of genuinely have positive expectations, if that's even possible""). Anyways, when I've had the 'positivity' switch on for a few hours, I'm completely and utterly drained, and if it's the weekend, I just collapse and wall myself up at home in hopes to regain my energy for the coming week.

I should probably state that I struggle a fair bit with social anxiety (maybe due to being alone ever since university 8 years ago? I really don't know why, but I did start isolating myself when I started uni, eg. never had a romantic partner out of fear, and also took some sort of pride in the fact that I shouldn't need to have one just to survive, and ""life is about surviving after all""), and I'm going to these group therapy lessons, but I have no idea if I even belong there. I know I can ""keep the act together"" _really_ well (or I guess I wouldn't have a job at all, or a much shittier one or so). And part of me wonders if that's all there is to ""not having social anxiety"" (being able to keep it together and not break down and get odd looks from those around you #fakeittillyoumakeit?).

I get really low quality sleep as well on most days, for some reason. I think bad sleep is as much a symptom as a cause of just ""feeling crap"" though. I know I should be sleeping more :sweat_smile:

also, thank you for bothering to read this far through my whiny rant. Getting it off my chest kinda helps I think.

tl;dr: I'm kinda the character that nobody should feel sorry for being born with a silver spoon and all. I have pretty much nothing to be bothered by in terms of friends,family,health, and the material. But for some reason find it hard to enjoy anything. Everything is weird to me, and I don't trust people.

(I love my boyfriend to death, I just fear losing him and becoming distant) I struggle to smile unless it’s fake and at work. 

I’m struggling with life. I am finding it extremely difficult and I don’t know what to do. I’ve suffered from suicidal thoughts in the past and I don’t like the feeling of having them again because they ruin everything.

This is the first time I’ve ever told anybody about this.**

I know this sounds weird, but hear me out.

I’ve just felt so lonely and down, that my fantasies have taken off. Some are sexual, some aren’t. I just like to lay in bed and do nothing more than cry. While I cry, I imagine fictional characters (some made up and some from actual series) loving me. Like, imagine them holding me, hugging me and letting me cry On them.

It’s gotten to a point where I literally get lost in thought. If they tell me a joke, I laugh. If the say it’s going to be alright, I smile. If they give me a kiss on the cheek and tell me they love me, I get overjoiced. It’s an addiction at this point.

Also, I guess it’s a coping mechanism. Because when I do this I feel happy and I feel like I can cry to them. They are my friends, but they only exist in my mind. I feel like I can pour my heart out to them and let my anxiety and pent up depression go when they are holding me.

I’ve been doing this for years but I didn’t realize it was a coping mechanism until I would cry over NOTHING, and just get lost in thought thinking about them. They make me laugh, cry, smile and angry. But, I love every second of it.

A few years before I was first diagnosed with depression I created a character who I named “Kuni.” She has black hair, green hairs and her skin is very pale. She has been my best friend for 6 years. She has been with me through the worst of my depression and she has been there to hold me when I was down. I really love her and I don’t know what I would do without her. She’s just one of the friends in my mind

I just wasn't interested in anything anymore and I smoked lots of weed, although I was kinda succesfull and people looked up to me. I was a ""skateboarding"" athlete who was sponsored. Kinda cool but I had a feeling inside that didnt care about a thing. I had a girlfriend who loved me the best, looking back  at it now it wasnt so bad back then, this was 2015.

Then the first really bad thing happened, I broke my ankle and shattered my leg, this kinda ruined my skateboarding carreer but not completely, I was out for 6 months. I didnt go to school and saw no people in the rehabtime except for my girlfriend and sometimes like once in 2months I saw ""friends"". 

In 2016 I wad back but the injury made me socially awkard because I was isolates for so long, meanwhile the depression only got bigger. The year moved by and it was 2017.

I can remember that i watched 13 reasons why, this serie inspired me for the first time to commit suicide, my situation kinda was the same as in 2016, my leg got a little better but not 100% I still had some status so that was okay, but still I was depressed a reason for the suicidal thougths was tinntitus and HPPU ( a weird sympton which weakens your viewing, its like a TV without a channel). I had this symptons because I did XTC sometimes, out of all the people I knew nobody had anything like it... and we went to the same partys and used the same drugs. However my life went one and I slowly startes rolling in a life I liked, I had a girlfriend I jusg started a new study my sport was going well and I had work. But then I got injured again very badly, I tore my ACL, MCl and LCL. I knew how bad injury's were and what they do to you mentally so ye... it hit me heavy. At the moment of the injury I knew that it would cost me everything ( girlfriend, school, status) and it did. In the rehab I smoked a lot of weed but like 24/7. When i quit, 6months in the rehab I got really really depressed all the emotions of loss hit me at once. And the rehab didnt go as plan at all.
It was end 2018 now and my girlfriend of 5 years told me she didnt want this anymore, "" how can I be with someone who doesn't smile"" This broke my heart in pieces. I didnt know who i was anymore and I lost everything. I also dropped.out of uni because of all the shit that was going, but this is not the worst part yet.

6 months later in the spring of 2019 I was slowly crawling out of my depressive&amp;suicidal thoughts and I started to see some new hope! I was finally back after 1.5 years of rehabbing at skateboarding and my status slowly came back it felt amazing. I found a new study and was makibg futureplans I was gonna win this situation and although I had a brokenheart I was finally able to do my thing agaib but not for long. My first session out of my comfort zone I tore my ACL again... this litterly broke me l. The day of the injury I told my parents I was done, it was too much. I knew how hard the rehab was and what it did mentally to me, I was fucking scared and really thought this was gonna be the end of me. Wihtout sport I simply cant feel.happy I tried a lot. I had to wait 3months for surgery in the meantime I did Personal training to strengthen my knee. I did lots of drugs and had some really bad destructive behaviour. I started smoking cigarettes to litterly kill myself. I started drinking a lot ane became a bitter person. Now 6 months into the rehab ( it takes normally 1 year ) im doing quite fine sometimes, other times im suicidal.again and I created this thinkingpattern made out of nihilism and hate towards every living thing. But at the same time I am incredibly sad for how things went. I know I want the best for the things and people I love but there is a voice in my head which says im and everyone else ia better of dead because of the cruelity of the world we live in. Currently im abusing medicines like xanax, for a short period of time I just started doing them and they help to relax. I'm lost and really like some advice and emphatizing in the situation. I cant talk about this with people i know.. :(

Things just haven’t been easy and seem to be getting tougher in front of my eyes. Things were never easy, I guess I was just better at coping in the past then I am now.

I have already accepted that I’m going to do it, I just never take the actual step. Same old story as others, I’m sure. I certainly don’t pretend that my experience is unique. There’s always one more thing I feel I should do first, for whatever random reason. Therapists and armchair psychologists will suggest that it’s because I really don’t want to do it, but I don’t think that’s true at all. 

First of all, I know me better than strangers who just hear or read my words, even though I know they mean well. No offense, but I do not tolerate know-it-all online strangers who attempt to psychoanalyze me...the next worst thing would be to be forced to listen to some “professional” tell me all about my experience, when in reality, they just do not know. It takes real time to truly know a person’s experience, and not all “facts” about people who struggle with suicidal thoughts are true for all.

Just please accept that you might know not what’s best for me better than I do. I concede that my own judgment may not be entirely trustworthy when it comes to my own life, but I also fully accept that my thoughts about YOUR life also may not be entirely trustworthy. I’m. Not. You. I just suggest that whether I should or should not do it is not based on your own preconceived notions about the issue. “Suicide is never an option” is copout, bumper-sticker philosophy nonsense, and I reject it as an axiom. And saying that to someone is a sure-fire way to have them never even want to talk about the issue. 

Second, if there were a button I could push that would make my life stop immediately without any sort of trauma, I would do it. I truly don’t have enough to look forward to in order to stay, even though I do find things that amuse me on a daily basis. That’s just mitigating misery, and it does not mean I do not want to stop living. Again, people say this (at least that’s what I’ve read), but I reject it as truth; it’s what people are expected to say, because the perception is always that taking your own life is wrong, which I disagree with. 

But I do have to accept that I am extremely hesitant to take the next step, and I’m sure most people here would list all of the same reasons that I would list if I were to actually list the reasons that I hesitate. We who face this struggle know all of the reasons we struggle. I’m not unique that way. I have enough self-awareness to know that my struggle is likely very common with those suffering chronic depression.

Hell, I don’t know exactly where this is going, and I might even regret posting it after I do. If you’re reading it, obviously I haven’t yet deleted it. And maybe I’m posting this just in case there are others who have a very similar inner struggle in their head, and they want to know their experience is not unique or they aren’t alone with this kind of thinking.

I have a few friends going through 'stuff' ATM and it's brining me down. My mom and dad were on the brink of divorce when I visited at Christmas. I end up helping everyone else. I can't help but feel very, very bitter as they get attention and help and I get nothing. I just want someone to listen to everything. *Everything*.

I'm too weak to ever go to the doctor about this. It's horrible that all the depression advice online is all ""Oh, you're strong if you seek help"". Well fucking THANKS, clearly I'm not strong, I'm weak. I'm not burdening friends with this (never once mentioned it to them, in 16 years, except one of my friends at uni, who has her own problems and \[I mean this in the nicest way possible\] isn't really mature enough to be able to help). I don't talk to my parents about it anymore. They don't deserve it. They cycled through blaming themselves to anger at me. I've tried counselling (therapy) twice and I've gotta say, it is one humongous load of bullshit! Oh boy! I *paid* to sit in a room filled with little Buddha statues with some middle-aged woman called Linda or Julie who divides her time between looking at the clock on the wall, glaring at me when I get upset, taking dubious notes (which I never get to see) and asking ""hOw DoEs ThAt MaKe YoU fEeL?"". Oh, how does it make me feel? It makes me feel *shit*. Like I *always* feel, dickhead.

I recently got into a relationship (the first 'proper' relationship I've had) and I hated it. I don't feel normal. I didn't like sex at all (I'm a guy). I think I must be asexual. But I don't want to be. I used to think I was gay, but really it's just an aesthetic attraction to dudes; I don't find anyone *sexually* attractive. I think I'd be fine never dating (hate texting, feel trapped as soon as I start dating anyone, hate sex, get social interation from my good group of mates, am too ugly for anyone to find attractive anyway, hate the gay 'community' and don't fit in) but what will I tell my family? They're bound to ask at some point why I don't have a girlfriend. I *wanted* to be gay just so I could come out to them, and get it over with. Unless they can also see I'm too ugly.

I've lost so much confidence recently. Confidence I'd gained since getting a job after leaving school. I've started to feel nervy and anxious about a lot of things. I remember once incident when I was 20; I had been beating my head against my bed for 10 minutes, without really realising it, just because I didn't want to go to work. I couldn't leave the house for weeks. That was probably my worst, and I feel right now I'm heading in that direction again very quickly.

I've also started getting nightmares and weird 'flashbacks' (I can't think of a less dramatic word, sorry!) to bullying at school and some stuff that happened when was in nursery; the two women who ran the nursery locked me in a cupboard because I wouldn't stop crying when I missed my mom. I'm sorry if this is weird and too specific but God I just don't know what to do. I don't know why I'm writing all this. The other part of this nightmare is the two nursery staff touching me up- I know I used to have this same nightmare a lot at the time. I feel like my brain is lying to me, but with my recent experience with deciding that I hate sex (I'm sorry, my vocabulary about this kind of thing is very poor) I feel like maybe it *did* happen?

I'm a 26-year-old man and none of this should be affecting me. I try so hard (I think) to get better. I exercise every day and eat healthily. I try as best I can to sleep. Usually I can pretend when I am with friends but lately I just stare into space. I *want* someone to notice. I want to try and kill myself in a dramatic way; to get attention. I've tried to self-harm and hand myself in the past but not successfully. I even fail at that. I'm not brave enough to drink bleach or even to cut my wrists- I tried the other day. I can't even kill myself properly- that's how much of a failure I am. I've called Samaritans once or twice in the past, but they obviously weren't interested (who can blame them? They're understaffed, overworked volunteers listening to me whinge when I should be grateful).

There is a lot more, really, but I won't write it all. I'm sorry this is so long. No one has to reply.

I've been stuck at this weird impasse where depression is no longer a daily thought, but I haven't been happy.  I've just been there basically. I'm not really happy or sad, just kind of empty.  Emotionless.

 I am no one's best friend.  A lot of people could be considered my friends, but I don't really know if they are.  I only talk to them at school and none of them associate with me any other time.  I have a friend group, but I'm only really there to make them feel better for themselves and to help them.  I'm not invited anywhere with them and they don't really talk to me unless they want someone to rant to.    
I had someone that I considered a best friend for years.  Half of my life to be exact.  But she's been drifting lately, and neither of us is ready to mention it. We don't talk anymore outside of school and she usually ignores me when I try to start a conversation.  There are times where we seem fine and back to normal, but any time any of her other friends are around it's like I no longer exist. She doesn't consider me a best friend. So I don't have a best friend nor could I be considered one.    
I don't know why this realization has hurt me so much, but it has.  I've been left with this emptiness that won't leave.  When I'm around my 'friends' my mood is killed by the fact that I'm an afterthought.  No one listens to me, no one talks to me, no one cares about me. They leave me behind without a thought, and my opinion never matters.  They sit there and make plans and I just sit there, all-around numb.

My depression, as I am finding out, is similar but different to most. I am not sad nor happy. I have no interests in hurting myself. I am empty. Hollowness is the best way to describe it.

Though I can’t enjoy it sometimes. Living in the moment is a chalange. I feel as if I am waiting for things to go bad. I have no clue why but yeah. I have no clue how this will go. I am worried that I am just going to slip back but hopefully not.

Stop. Saying. That. 

I hate it as much as you do, I just want to be free from my mind. I am my worst enemy. I hate myself. I hate myself so fucking bad, you have no idea, and I hate my situation, I hate my life and I am trying to control my emotions... It's **NOT** easy. 

Did you ever get in your car and thought: Huh, maybe this time I will die? And feel almost disappointed you haven't finished in a car crash?  
Have you ever crossed the road and almost got hit by a car and was like: Damn, it was close!

Started to cut vegetables, and thought about hurting yourself?  
Hang yourself? Fall off a bridge? 

There are honestly thousands of ways I could have ended my life, for many horrible reasons, my own demons eating me, my own anxiety taking the best of me and my depression taking away my self worth.  I feel like shit and like I don't deserve a place here and my loved ones deserve better. I am lost. I am alone. I feel horribly... horribly numb.

This will be my last post on my Reddit account until I come back; if I do. 


As I laid myself down to sleep, I heard him speak to me.  “hello son, how you doing. I think inside you know your happy, but can’t show it. You know girls don’t bite, I know they may have once or twice, but one day you’ll meet an amazing girl, hopefully, one like my wife.” 


It’s time to turn the next chapter in my life.
I’m a man now,I have responsibilities. And more importantly, I have a lot of internal reflection to do. I will not comeback until I discover more about myself, I will not comeback until I become a man in my eyes.


Final note: Do you know what it’s like to get rejected by a girl, then have to witness her obsessing over some other guy in your class?  Do you know what it’s like to see a group of girls talking about how cute that same kid is in a picture? Do you know what it’s like to not be enough? Yeah, you’ll probably laugh and call me names but that stuff sticks with you.  How can I be expected *not* to hold a grudge against girls?  At the same times this curse makes me extremely hard in my life. I’ll never be a loser like that again. I hope something I can answer before I return is this,  how can I truly ever trust a girl when they bring nothing but pain?

I was having trouble with school and was being told my everyone to drop out and I just did not want to. I wanted everyone to consider all of my resources and all that they could do to help and I guess I began to stress everyone out. 

As a back story, my grandmother raised me. Ever since I was two months old, my mother basically abandoned me and left me with her, and my dad, I guess, saw his role as a father as a part time duty (he came and went.) It’s always been me and my grandmother through everything. 

I’m in my second year of college. I’m about to start my first semester of being a computer science major. I’ve basically had to struggle my way through college and my grandmother has been as much of a help as she can. Something happened with my school a week ago and it hiked my tuition up by 225%. My grandmother can’t afford that. I know that she can’t afford that. But, at the same time, I can’t afford to be a college drop out. I don’t want to be stuck in the lower-middle class just living from pay cheque to pay cheque like my grandmother has to. 

Now, back to yesterday. I had been sad and crying all day and just, in general, miserable. I couldn’t figure out a plan for school and I had an argument with my so the night before and he wasn’t talking to me so I was sad and emotional about that. My grandmother came home later in the day from work and she was really tired. But, because she is my grandmother, she has to bother herself and do everything for me. When she came home I began whining about school, she asked me to cook and I burned everything up and I just was not being proactive with the simple things that she was asking me to do. 

She said that she was tired of me. It’s not the first time she’s said it, but this time she sounded so resolved and finished with me and the rest of the night she kept getting mad at me and annoyed with me for random little things.

to make things worse, i had another job interview today. i got triggered by one of the questions and started crying while answering it. not a good look. i hope i get it...but at the same time i don’t. what’s funny is that before i had my interview, the lady at the front desk told me to email her in case the interview doesn’t go well. she worked in a different floor of the building. she said she’ll be hiring soon in the summer. i guess in a weird way, that was the universe foreshadowing things for me. that’s the only upside of the day that i had. a random lady offering me a job in case things don’t go well. you bet your ass i emailed her. 

anyways, i’m feeling pretty low. i feel like my personality is what makes jobs hard for me. i can fake an upbeat personality at first, but then it fades. not to mention, i have bipolar disorder. so it’s really hard to maintain my moods. and it shows.  boy does it show. i just wish people would stop judging me for how i act(or lack of action). i know know it’s unreasonable, but i wish i could be like other people. i wish i could maintain a facade the way they do. oh how i wish i could.",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,592630,public,confidence,self,"having a really, really bad day.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/es4ov8/having_a_really_really_bad_day/,no_ads,0.0

Six months ago we reconnected, I proceeded with a lot of caution. But after a month or two of talking and finding out her situation I offered her a roof over her head temporarily so she could learn to stand on her own feet. I was scared but I felt compelled to help, I always try to help. 

But I made it clear it was just as friends, cause I believed in her. I wanted her to do all the things she said she wanted to do. To grow for herself and maybe then we'd revisit the idea of us. I drew that line in the Sand but she wanted to share a bed and sleep together, then started getting feelings for me again. I told her I was still learning to trust her and to focus on herself. But that I did feel things for her too but it was more important to do what she set out to so that if we decided to try again it'd be real. She took that as rejection I suppose. And the lies started. She kept telling me she felt she had to report to me, despite telling her numerous times she could do as she wanted and to just not treat me like garbage. But she'd volunteer lies to me, so the fighting began. But I tried to stop it but it continued. 

I had worked for years to get rid of my depressed head space. She lied and cheated but I fought back. Worked on myself. She appears again, issues begin and with the same few months life again hits me at once, I then find out my father has cancer and despite being estranged it hits hard. A week after that the mother of my son wants him to move in with me starting in summer, while this is fantastic, I'm broke and now stressed about moving into a better school district for him. Only a few weeks after that she crashes my car. My job which I enjoyed had changed so much for the worse I had been job hunting, one finally paid off, but now I have to sort out a new job great but stressful. And try to figure out how to afford a new car. My anxiety attacks become daily and more intense than ever I couldn't finish out my two weeks due to how intense they were getting. Then within the same week as I start my new job she pushes me too far, after multiple big lies she vanished and I'm getting threats from her crazy father and her to blackmail me for letting her live with me (my lease says only I am a resident) I snap, tell her to get out. She's gone the next day. 

After it seems done, I have damn near a heart attack at only 30, I realized that the medications I was on were triggering serotonin syndrome, a very terrible interaction between certain serotonin boosting meds. That's what I was dealing with not normal anxiety attacks but things I thought were that were just cardiac issues. 

So there it is. I figured out my physical issue. Done,  changed my meds. I got rid of her. I got a new car day after be she left with help from my grandparents. I sorted out a plan for figuring out getting my son here and am working on it slowly until summer arrives. I'm still learning how to deal with my fathers illness and how it hits me but I'm taking it I stride. I like my new job, great company, much better money, I actually can buy food and pay bills without borrowing. I toughed it out, I got cut down in a lot of ways in only a 2 month span. But j got through it.

So I'm back to normal, but normal means I'm alone. I'm cut off from others cause I don't know how to reach out anymore, these last few months aren't the first time I been cut down like this. But before when I made it through it felt good. I felt like I won. Now this time I know I won against the problems. I made it through. With help from my mother but I made it. But it's a hollow victory almost, because after getting through it all I feel the same loneliness and emptiness I did before. Maybe even more because even if she didn't break my heart this time, I had pinned hopes on her redemption, not cause I was making her but because she said she wanted to. I thought if I could help then I could see the good in people again. But that didn't happen. 

I'm working out again. Playing games again. Trying dating sites cause I think I want to try casual stuff again. I'm not under any delusions. I'm sure I screwed up plenty due to the stress in how I dealt with my ex. It bothers me still after almost 2 months that I kind of gave her the boot (kind of cause well I told her she could stay long enough to find a new place if she could make sure it wasn't a risk to me, since her and her father were making threats, she showed up next day with uhaul) I feel like hell most days now. I'm alone just me and my dog. I struggle at best of times to meet people. Now I feel so jaded and hateful I almost can't. 

What's the point in writing all this? Hell if I know. But I wanted to. I've been in this kind of spot before, I kept going then. And I will now even if it feels hollow. It's all I know how to do. I want to stop sometimes, I want to give up. I don't have much of a future sight at the moment. I don't believe in God or an afterlife. But I'll keep going anyway even though it hurts, enough though I feel somewhat dead inside. 

Maybe this is just me trying to vent off this pain stuck to my chest, maybe it's some half ass attempt at showing a story someone else might find helpful somehow.  Hell if I know. But I learned a long time ago to just do something, even if it seems pointless as long as it isn't harmful to yourself or others, then just do it. 

But if you read this far. All of that wall of text, whoever you are now know more about how I really feel than well pretty much everyone I know. Thanks for reading.

Nothing. I’m supposed to go my whole life, trying to live selflessly and kind and humble only to hope that because I lived as a good person I have some eternal reward when I die?

Am I supposed to live for the other people here? What’s my purpose? What is the point? Was I put on this hunk of rock hurtling through the universe for others? What is all of this supposed to be about? 

All my life I’ve gone through one thing after another. If it wasn’t being molested as a kid, it was being uprooted and shipped somewhere else with a family who didn’t pay enough attention, being used and abused by more men as I got older, to being so deep in debt I thought I would never get out, being so close to getting out of that debt to it doubling basically overnight. 

Everyone always says that things get better with time, but it seems like life only gets worse the longer I’m alive. Making a bucket list? Traveling the world? That’s temporary comforts. Wants only exist to harm and hurt us and pour salt in this gaping wound we call a life. 

One day we are all going to fade away and cease to exist. We aren’t going to be around to see the world end with the children of our children and so forth. And why do humans even want to have children? To continue their suffering? To carry the burden of their parents? Care for us when we get old and can’t do shit for ourselves, let alone anyone else? Yeah, I say a big fuck you to that. If I wish I wasn’t born, then surely my kid or grandkids somewhere down the line will wish the same thing.

Lately I find myself more and more frustrated because I know I need help with depression but it's really hard to get any help.

I feel like i'm a burden on my friends for all the complaining I do about being depressed and some of my friends outright think I'm just lazy or incompetent because I know what I need to do but I just don't want to do it. I have a bit of anxiety about paperwork and also about talking to strangers so I haven't seen any doctors since I turned 18. I don't want to be a burden on my friends or family and as much as people say ""oh no you won't be a burden"" I know it's a lie because I've lost relationships over this shit and you'll never forget the day someone tells you you're suffocating them with your mental illness and they don't want to talk to you anymore.

Whenever I think about this stuff I get this feeling of anxiety like my back is against the wall and my only option seems to be to just kill myself. I don't want to die, but this intense sadness and misery is just too much to carry alone. I don't think I'll ever date again, I have very few friends, and no medical professionals to seek advice from. I just want to be happy. I don't want to self medicate and put myself in a worse situation, but sometimes it's tempting to just drink until I don't fear death anymore and just go for it, although I don't drink at all right now because I know it makes me feel worse.

I am a wife and a mother to young kids. I am a nurse, and I just graduated last spring after years of on-and-off trying. I've suffered from depression for years, which was ramped up by some childhood trauma drama in 2013 as well as some postpartum dives. It has been a long time since I truly felt like I was in control. Until a few months ago - I finally got back on my meds (had gone off during nursing school due to troubling side effects). I started losing weight and walking every day, I was able to play with my kids more, my sex life was improving.

Well, a few months ago my hip starting hurting. I woke up one morning and it was sore. I have an active job and not much time for health issues, so I just kinda limped around for a while until it got worse. Went to a clinic and got steroid shots for bursitis. Eventually got an x-ray which was normal, but the pain persisted despite all the usual treatments, so I finally went to an ortho and got an MRI.

And that is how I learned I have something called avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis. Basically the blood supply to my hip joint was cut off somehow and the bone started to die. My right hip has started to collapse, but even worse - my left hip and right knee are also affected, plus who knows how many other joints we haven't scanned yet. I'll likely be getting a right hip replacement in the coming months, followed by painful and intense surgeries in the other affected joints to try to restore blood flow, and then having those replaced in the next few years as well. And we don't even know what caused this, which means it'll probably keep happening in other joints, on and on.

Did I mention I am 28 with two young kids, and I had *just* started to feel like I was getting my life back? And now I'll be in a perpetual state of pain and under the knife for the rest of my life. I can't jump on the trampoline with my kids anymore, or run another 5k, or learn to play tennis like I was just talking about with a friend.

You were an idiot and a cunt in 2012, but remember:

* You were bullied and humiliated at your high school, until you decided to leave
* The year group spread a rumour targeted you after a misunderstanding
* You had conflict with a religious school which discourages questioning
* Your mother shouted you down for asking to change
* When you changed, people rudely asked why you changed
* 2 teachers wanted you to leave their class, and 1 was rude because you weren’t working
* One student started calling you awkward regularly, and another called you a dumbass
* You were hanging out with other kids who’d stir the pot
* You were 16. 16 year olds have an undeveloped brain, which doesn’t have good judgement or awareness of long-term consequences.

&gt;In fact, recent research has found that adult and teen brains work differently. Adults think with the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s rational part. This is the part of the brain that responds to situations with good judgment and an awareness of long-term consequences. Teens process information with the amygdala. This is the emotional part.  
&gt;  
&gt;In teen’s brains, the connections between the emotional part of the brain and the decision-making center are still developing—and not always at the same rate. That’s why when teens have overwhelming emotional input, they can’t explain later what they were thinking. They weren’t thinking as much as they were feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

You were a cunt in 2014-2015, but it makes sense:

* You didn’t pass school
* Your mother was actively shouting you down for wanting to go to university
* You were raised around a strong connection between success in life and university, which your parents would misrepresent and dismiss you for wanting to do
* All your friends were gone at university
* This situation would drive you into tears
* You had your first major break-up, which left you in tears
* You felt like you couldn’t trust your parents or open up to them
* You were suicidal, and your mother didn’t believe you and would discourage you from taking antidepressants
* You were frequently dismissed as “too sensitive”
* You were a teenager. Again, you had an undeveloped brain - poor judgement.
* You were reasonably lonely
* Online creators you felt a connection to went against each other
* You introduced some friends to others, and they responded by shitting on you

&amp;#x200B;

I was always trying to be understood instead of understanding. Swallowing this truth, that I love her, is for me very hard. Pressure in my eyes is currently like two fingers pushing from behind. Tears have been streaming down my face for who knows however long. It's only taken me 19 years to realize this. I was told I would never be judged, frowned upon, or deserted by her. That if her only reason on Earth was to my constituent, that would be enough.

She wants for me what she never had, that I shouldn’t move too fast forward in life as she did. To take advantage of the love that she has to offer and is more than willing to give. I have heard this from her before, but this is the first time that I truly know this. 

Air is so abundant that you may never think about it, surrounding your body as you lie in bed, as your fingers move to the pace of your typing, as you walk on uneven cement sidewalks through your neighborhood looking at sycamore trees towering above.

Until you are deprived of it.

I have unknowingly taken the jump headfirst into the deepest form of water there is, entering adulthood and leaving behind everything I thought I knew I was. Everything I thought I knew I had. The truth that I thought I knew is now a distant memory, a reminiscent breeze.

I know it sounds pretty random, but things haven't been going easy for me in the past three years. I can safely say that - for most of 2019 - waking up to a new day was torturous. I felt like I was just waiting to die. Waiting for something bad to happen so I could stop suffering. I never tried to harm myself, but I would be lying if I said I didn't get myself into some risky situations. I didn't care about myself. I just wanted a rush, anyway I could get.

I'm 27 years old now, unemployed for four years. I have social anxiety and I have a hard time coping with the fact that my family doesn't accept me for being gay. I still talk to my mom and dad, but I moved on from living with them to be a guest in a friend's family home. Sooner or later, I going to have to move on from here too and I'll probably end up having to go back to my parents house.  Everyday I look in the mirror, I'm getting bald. I'm very thin and I have a very bad image of myself. I hate being around people for the most part, and god forbid I have to get behind a counter to sell something to save my life, that's probably when I would prefer dying.

Good news is, I don't feel like I want to die anymore. Maybe it's just a mood swing, maybe it's permanent, but my will to die went away. I think about getting old, seeing new things, playing new games, making stuff. I consider myself to be really creative and I realized I can do the things I love to myself. I might not be able to ever write a book, but I'll sure try. I might not be able to ever make a video game, but I'll sure try. I might not be able to ever draw cool maps and fantasy worlds, but I'll sure try. 

I realized I have dreams, plans and I love the process of creating stuff in many different areas. Discovering, learning, finding the little jigsaw pieces that make a beautiful puzzle, those have always been my pleasures and I definitely want to keep going. I also have a 4 year old nephew, which I really, really love. I need to teach him to discover the world too. I feel responsible for it, even if my outlook right now is still pretty bad.

I still get sad, at times. I still think about suicide, but those images of a brighter future keep coming and keep making me want to go on. I don't know where if coming from though, but I'm getting happier. I started taking a medication four months ago and I'm still going. If it turns out it's the medication, please, if you're reading this and you still having looked for medical help, go for it. If you can't or maybe you don't want to, I feel like, somewhere in our heads, those hopes and dreams we gave up on are still there. Maybe tomorrow will be another horrible day, then the next day after it.

But I now believe that everyday we wake up, we do say because we love something. We do so because our brain is telling us, get up, I want to enjoy whatever the world still has to us.

Probably, I don't know. I'm not suicidal and never have been. It's just that if I look at my life I can observe a steady decline into complete emotional numbness.

I look back at different phases of my life now and think of emotions I had at the time and think ""wow, there's no way I could ever feel that again"". I am physically incapable of opening up to anyone, and it's starting to cause problems in my marriage.

I just had a fight with my wife because she wanted me to open up. So of course I just stared at her and said nothing as usual. Then she got even angrier because I wasn't upset. I'm just calm, as always. 

It seems like the only emotion I feel is irritation. Not even anger, I get frustrated when something or someone isn't how I want it to be. I don't feel sad, I don't feel happy, I just feel nothing. 

I've told me wife that I feel nothing inside before. She took this to mean that I don't love her, so I had to backpedal and say that I do love her. Which is true...as much as it can be. I don't know if I really even know what loving someone feels like. I want to be with her for the rest of my life, that's love, right? At least that's what I thought myself when we got married.

She's so worried that if we had kids I would be distant from them and not love them. Maybe she's right? I don't know.

Depression can be experienced differently and uniquely by each person, but overall there are some things that everyone who suffers with it can relate to and understand, no matter what end of the scale you’re on. It seldom comes alone, usually paired with anxiety of some kind, BPD, OCD or something like insomnia.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ll give you an example of how it’s hit me today, I’ve spent the past few days around people I love and care about more than I can put into words here, with a lot of laughter and love - yet I’ve been feeling *off*. Slept okay, eaten well, generally been happy. But I have that sinking feeling, I had all day long to play video games, watch films and essentially do what I please, but I didn’t have any energy, any focus, or any want - I wanted to *want* to do those things. I even tried, but half an hour later and I couldn’t manage it. I felt so drained. For no logical reason, I hadn’t done a workout, I’d managed 6 hours sleep and I was hydrated and had nothing in my mind bothering me.

I fell asleep about two hours later at 7pm after going for a walk with music to try and clear my mind and get some fresh air for a second wind to carry me through the evening until bed, but it didn’t really help, I still felt awful. Woke up around 10pm, tried to force myself back to sleep so I wasn’t out of sync, but here I am, writing  and adding to this essay at half past midnight.

Of all the things that I could be bothered by with depression, mentioned mostly above, what really cripples me about it is the fact that it changes who I am. By this, I mean that usually, I’m quite jovial, I’m sarcastic, witty, laugh about it all kind of person, but when I feel like I do now, it’s hard to crack a joke, or to think of one. It’s tough to laugh at the banterous insults that we usually throw at one another which all mean “I love you”.

The worst part of this change is that people think that you’re mad at them, that they’ve done something and it’s their fault. That because you aren’t all smiles and you’ve put headphones on, in an effort to listen to music and regain some balance, that you’re trying to drown them out or ignore them when you aren’t, when it’s actually because you need music to chill but you don’t want to force them to listen to it because your music tastes differ.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the time on social media, there’s posts and memes and that sorta stuff where it’s referenced in either a super serious way, trying to raise awareness, or as many do, use the jokes as a coping mechanism so you don’t cry yourself into a hot mess about your problems. Most of the time when I see these posts and memes, my only interaction is to like it and if it’s a good meme; save it. Seldom do I comment or contribute in any fashion - unless it’s a friend in need.

So this suggests that we do in fact share common attributes of depression and I’m sure if you want to get technical, then that’s why it’s becoming more recognised and diagnosable in people. But there’s nothing better when going through some of the horrible experiences and illnesses to know that you aren’t the only one who is dealing with it, or has made it out the other side of it.

&amp;#x200B;

For now I can’t recall exactly who, my mind is telling me it’s Russell Howard, but he makes a point about how “stress” is simply a rebrand of the word “unhappy” and he gives examples.

“I’m stressed out about work, the mortgage, the kids and life in general”, would be something you’d say and we all accept that’s the way life is and there’s not much to be done about it, but if you said “I’m *unhappy* about work, the mortgage, the kids and life in general”, we try to do something about it because we don’t want to be unhappy. Because being stressed has become the norm and being unhappy is okay in part, but not as a continuous feeling.

This makes a ton of sense to me, it really spoke to me and connected some of the dots. I was about thirteen when I first started suffering from insomnia and depression, now at the time I didn’t realise that’s what it was really, in my mind, I was just sad about being a fat kid, rarely fitting in (no pun intended) and I would get bored of not falling asleep at night - so I’d play video games and eventually fell for the nonsense that it was the screen keeping me up.

To clarify, I am aware about bluelight and trouble games etc cause with sleeplessness so to make it crystal clear, I was struggling to fall asleep with nothing going on, until approx 3-4am when I’d then get bored and get up since school was only a few hours away. There’s a lot more that was happening in my life back then that looking back on it I was able to realise why I felt how I did etc, but I won’t go into that for personal reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a few weeks ago, I attended a mental illness seminar for the benefit of someone else. 99% of what was discussed during the two hour event was stuff me and this other person had already known so it felt kinda useless going, but you go just in case that 1% helps. What **did** help was that the other people attending were exactly that; they were human. People looking for answers and where those leading the seminar couldn’t answer, others in the room chimed in with what worked for them etc.

You had realness, people opening up about themselves and loved ones instead of staying silent for fear of being different or embarrassed **AND IT WORKED**. You could feel everyone in the room relax and a few people looked like they wanted to cry because they realised themselves and their loved ones are not alone. After the event came to a close, a woman came straight over to me from another table because I’d spoken up about my insomnia when the topic of ‘how to use positive language’ or something like that:

I’d mentioned how suffering with insomnia and poor sleep patterns, ‘jokey’ phrases and greetings can quickly become commonplace and stick for a long time, which if you have thick skin and a good sense of humour can be brushed off, but even then it can bring you from bad to worse.

So I gave the example that, when you suffer with it, you can often miss daylight and all the usual 9-5 things in life that other people do on a daily basis - even just getting some shopping. Then there’s the fact that you begin to hate yourself. Another day wasted. You’ve still got to mentally prepare yourself for it all tomorrow and make sure you do it because you’re on day three with no food.

You have to settle yourself down in an hour in order to make sure you have enough energy to do tomorrow and reset your pattern. You haven't showered yet, if you do, it could wake you up and have you up all night again, but if you don’t it’s something else you have to do tomorrow before going anywhere.

It can all stem from just being out of sync for one day. That’s all it takes, one day. Going to bed early, or being unable to sleep at night and you can be stuck in a bad loop for days to weeks and breaking the cycle is tough. If you live with other people, you can’t do something engaging during the night to keep you awake, usually because it rarely comes with zero noise. Or because your parents say you can’t do it and you need to sleep. For me it’s anxiety that I’ll wake someone and I find sleep to be a precious thing, so I don’t want to deprive others of that.

By the time that the sun is up and people are shuffling about to go to work and go about their day, you’re totalled, spent and utterly shattered because you’ve done very little but be awake when you want to sleep. For me, energy drinks only do two things, they make me awake for 10 minutes and then hardcore crash, and they make me pee. Same goes for tea and coffee. So before you know it, when it’s 10am and you’re trying super hard to stay awake, you pass out and it’s 5pm and it all starts over again.

On some days, managing to get up at a decent time, do some morning hygiene and making it downstairs to see family; that can sometimes take every bit of power you can summon to achieve that and sometimes it’s too much. To then be greeted with “ah so you’ve decided to join the land of the living” or a similar level of sarcastic comment can completely wipe you out. “Why did I even bother...” is the first thought I tend to have, “...I should have just stayed in bed”.

So me and this woman got to chatting about what I went through and what I found worked for me or people I knew, and what touched me was that she was concerned for her daughter who was suffering big time and she was trying to find out what she could do to help. I gave her some pointers and spoke about what to avoid doing etc. If that is the **ONLY** thing that changed in the world from that seminar, then that’s a win to me.

That mother no longer has to feel alone or useless because she can’t make her daughter’s problem go away, because she doesn’t have the answers or tools to help and that is the most soul destroying thing as a parent, to know your kid is going through hell and you can’t help them. But she has something now, it might not work, but it’s a direction to go in and it’s a light in the dark.

I think it was Robin Williams who was credited with saying that depression is like being in a room full of people and feeling alone. A man of many faces who gave such joy to us on screen and who as most of you will know, sadly committed suicide a few years ago.

This is where I get heavily opinionated and I want to state that I am not going to suggest that the things I go on to mention will work for you, only that they are coping strategies and parts of my personality that have developed to help me deal with my mental load, stress and depression.

To open this segment, the most useful thing I learned was the ‘spoons’ metaphor. This comes in a couple of other variations I’ve heard of, such as ‘eggs in the box’ and ‘mana’ for the gamers.

Imagine you have a limited number of spoons per day, this number is not fixed and does not stay the same every day. It can change based on how well you slept, if you have eaten well, stayed hydrated, how much you did the day before or a traumatic event etc. Each task in a day, even the tiny ones, will use a certain number of your spoons up, and once you’ve used all the ones available to you, you’ll suffer tomorrow by borrowing spoons to do more.

I’ll happily detail an example in comments or do another detailed post if that helps, but I’m aware this post is reaching a ridiculous length. The main lesson to be drawn from it is that you have a limit you can do and that it changes each day and doing more than your limit will force you to borrow from tomorrow. This isn’t a set rule and lots of factors alter your numbers here, so it’s best to try and measure this yourself if you can - if that’s a struggle for you, I’ll help however I can.

The lesson taught me that it’s okay to say “I can’t do anymore today”, which is hard when you’re a perfectionist and you kick yourself for not doing what you expect of yourself and falling short of that standard. It taught me to prioritise things and to praise myself for achieving the smallest of things to others. I managed to shower today, that’s a win. Those dishes got done and I can eat now, that’s a win. It sounds **SUPER** demeaning at first if you’re cynically wired like me, but it works, it takes a little bit of pressure off.

Now this is all going to sound very tangential, I was talking about Robin Williams, spoons, where is this going? Please stay with me.

He was a man of many faces and the truth is we all are, most of us have three faces, we have a work face, a family and friends face and our own face. This won’t be news to most of you, but for those who do not know this I’ll explain.

Our work face is the mask we wear when we deal with everyone else in the outside world who isn’t a friend or family. It’s smiles and nice voice and reserved personality, but it takes a huge drain on your spoons. The family and friends face is a mask we wear when we socialise and spend quality time with those we love, we come out of our shell here, laugh, chill and have a good time sometimes, but we still aren’t transparent. Our own face is our true self, it doesn’t define who we are entirely, but when we take of those other masks, we are tired and can feel alone.

That’s the idea most of us stick to and I’m here to controversially say that it doesn’t have to be like that, because when I was in that mindset it became a trap. Admin, I beg of you to read what I have to say here and consider it before deciding on whether this stays or goes.

In my own life, not drawing from anyone else, articles, studies or ideology, this is not the way forward. You are not a sad person, you are a **person**, who experiences sadness. You are not a depressed person, you are a **person** suffering with depression. I am not one of these “you’ll get over it” types. I still suffer heavily with my depression, but I want to reassure you that you have a personality and it is not only comprised of depression.

My personality is a sarcastic, cynical, witty, tongue in cheek humour and laughter is the best medicine kind of guy. I spent years of my life using that as my mask. Thinking that I was still just this very sad and depressed person and that’s all I was. I would hold back from saying things I found funny because I was so anxious that people wouldn’t like me, that they’d be offended or find me odd and weird. But that **IS** me, I am weird, I am odd, I am funny (my friends and family will scoff at that), I am all of those things and that’s okay. You’re allowed to be those things.

In fact, I wouldn’t want to be anyone else. I spent years trying so damn hard to be likeable and to be normal and fit in. It made me so unhappy and stressed and anxious and I could never be me. Bit by bit in my life I’ve stepped away from it. I’ve done what I wanted to do and say what I wanted to say and put myself and my interests first and it has done wonders for me. I’ve not become selfish and ignorant, because there is a balance. But instead of putting myself last, I’ve put myself not last.

And the friends and family I love and who love me, I know that they are under no illusion of who I am and what I go through. I trust them to call me out on things, and I’d do the same for them. It has helped rid me of the anxiety of people saying they care about me and being friends with me when the do not know me. If you can be true to who you are, the things you like and find passion in, you’ll find people who will like and love you for who you are - and those who decide that who you are, is reason to stop being a part of your life, are not people you want to be around.

All of the stuff I’ve mentioned above that is controversial and heavily opinionated is not gospel, please do not think that this is the answer or the only way forward. I encourage you to find strength in believing in yourself and trying to accept who you are. I still have my off days too, days I wake up and hate myself for my faults, but I know I have them, they are a part of me I want to change and I try to work on them, and that’s enough to be proud of.

I had a huge addiction to  online video games (Runescape and Dota 2) and internet in general  during the start of highschool and university. This replaced real life  and I'd stay up till 2am or so and play over 12 hours a day during the  holidays. I hardly went outside during those times. I believe this is  the cause of my problem but I've always been socially anxious since I  was a child which probably lead to the video gaming addiction.

My  dad was verbally abusive as a child, not towards me but he'd constantly  shout/swear in his language to himself daily and I'm pretty sure that  had a negative effect on me. He was abused by his own dad as a child. I  stopped talking to him completely highschool year 11 onwards after I  gave him the ultimatum to stop his constant shouting. I don't even think  he registered/understood my request and so I just stopped talking to  him and he didn't even really care. Now I do talk to him but it's super  infrequent, he's passive aggressive and I stay in my room most of the  time I'm home. I'm talking to my mum every day and also text my older  sister recently to get help.

I now  have a job as a programmer but I'm really struggling to cope. I just  don't see myself working in an office for the rest of my life. I  struggle to communicate verbally at work and this causes people to avoid  me and I feel isolated. The repetitiveness, lack of variety and just  staring at a computer all day is making me dread work. I feel like it's  making my problems worse as I'm not practising the skills I need to  improve my life by just programming all day. I'm considering just up and  quitting my job and switching to a trade job either electrician or  plumber, but that is a huge step backwards (it'd be around 1/3 of the  pay as an apprentice, and it's seen as a ""lower"" job than a professional  one in society) and I'm uncertain whether I will be able to get an  apprenticeship. However I enjoy the physical aspect, variety and being  outdoors and think it would help me improve the skills I need in life.

I've  suddenly recently awakened to the fact that I can't keep going like  this. I've quit a life of porn addiction and it's having a huge effect  on wanting to change my life. Every day I've been waking up with  thoughts of it's all hopeless now as I've wasted so many years. I've  started seeing the GP, talking to my sister and have booked an  appointment with the psychologist in 2 weeks. I've started getting back  into playing tennis which temporarily helps make me feel good from the  exercising/socialising. These are all significant signs of improvement  IMO and that things are drastically changing. The GP said my main  problem is severe depression and that it makes me lose motivation and  enthusiasm for life and my thoughts are really negative.",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,592653,public,confidence,self,Struggling with my life.

I’m not one for surprises, but a few days ago a good friend of mine and mother figure in my life surprised me with a cake for my birthday, and it was honestly better than my actual birthday.  On my actual birthday, I didn’t want a cake, or to ding happy birthday, but with her both of those came naturally.  Certain people are very fond to me in my life, and sometimes I keep mementos to remind me of them and their love.  For this particular one, I wanted to keep the cake container.

Every week, the trash and recyclables are set out to be collected.  My mother never does it herself and always delegates the responsibility to me.  Whatever.  Today she’s particularly nagging me about it, so I do it.  I noticed my container was placed with the recyclables, so I set it aside.  For whatever reason, she decides to re-bag it and tries to force me to toss it.  When I tell her I’m keeping it she wants an explanation.  I don’t particularly like talking about my intimate feelings and being judged for them, so I keep them to myself.  Then again, for whatever reason, my father is now involved and I have to tell both of them the same thing, essentially (paraphrasing): “I did what you wanted, stop bothering me and leave me alone.”  Then my father tells me I have a lot of growing up to do.  That hurt.  Why?  Because I am trying to.  Maybe I’m too attached to the past and what it held, but it sometimes calms me.

I remember when I had dreams for a bright future full of achievements and I felt loved by the people around me. I was 16 then. It all went to shit about 4 months after I turned 16.
I realised that everything I felt about myself, I felt because of others. I loved myself because others loved me. I had hopes because others hoped for me. I had achievements because I wanted to prove myself to others. But when I was 16, it all went to trash. Because my family, who since the day I was born had offered me nothing but unconditional love and support, decided to hate me. No love is unconditional. That’s what I should have known. 


I know it sounds stupid. But the days kind of blended together and I stoped writing. I stoped hanging out with people. I lost lots of friends. I have no passion for anything or anyone anymore. I lost all notions of fun, and I’m so pathetic that sometimes I watch a good movie or read a good book, and I cry because I remember I had forgotten of the feeling of feeling something. I hated myself because others hated me and I’ve never known self-love through anyone’s eyes but through the eyes of others. It’s like my unconscious doesn’t recognise its own existence.


I’m not always depressed. At some point when I was about to turn 17, I decided to start studying again. To stop missing school and sleeping for 14 hours straight everyday for the mere inability to carry the weight of my own body out of bed. So, I studied through all of 2019 and that’s all I did. 

I can’t believe that I allow myself to be depressed because my parents hate me. That’s stupid. Lots of people have parents who hate them and they live their lives just fine, happy. But it’s like I’m adjusting to feel hated, and they say it gets better with time. Maybe it does, but all the improvement I see, is the fact that I’m getting used to not feeling like a person. I don’t feel myself in my own body sometimes, I don’t have romantic feelings anymore, I don’t feel like going out or doing anything that’s not laying down in bed. And once upon a time, that used to devastate me. But now I’m just used to it.

It’s idiotic. Feeling like that. I know I shouldn’t. But I turn 18 tomorrow and I feel like I’m trapped in a rabbit hole of trauma that I can’t get over. It was sometime mid March of 2018 when I heard from my mother that she’d rather die slowly of cancer than have a daughter like me. That my dad nearly kicked me out of home and made me promise that I’d be someone I wasn’t until the day I could provide for myself, that my older sister nodded along with mom when she called me disgusting, and then later on said that I deserved it all.

Some days are better than others but I feel like I just tell myself that to justify treatment, and the meds.
Most days I have a moment or two of joy, the ""I'm happy, I'm better"" moments.
But even after being on medication daily and therapy close to weekly. I still feel zero difference than i did a year ago, if anything I'm worse off.
I know suicide isn't the answer,  because that's what you're suppose to say. But I'm so tired and done with lying to myself every morning, telling myself that I have to get better. I've been telling myself that for a decade and I'm still at rock bottom.
Some days I feel like pulling the trigger is my answer. Feeling nothing at all is better than feeling pain, right.
:/ 
I don't think I'd ever go through with it, but that thought is always there. TBH, I can't recall one day  that I  haven't thought about suicide...

However, despite our relationship not being the longest or the most recent, for me, it is one of the most intense, confusing, and hurtful times I've ever experienced. I need to tell someone how it looks to me and why, so I can continue to let go and move forward. No one seems to understand understand why her actions hurt me so much. 


Our time was a roller-coaster of over a year between connecting, being originally ghosted, us, our breakup, seeing  her with the guy she told me not to worry about , and being ghosted again. She ghosted me three times for two different men; before, during, and after our time together. She lead me into a very intense relationship, then backpedaled and abandoned said relationship almost overnight with little regard for my feelings or attempts to communicate. She then abandoned her promise of friendship and support and blamed it on assumed feelings of mine, without actually talking to me. 


Not three weeks after asking me to meet her family and go exclusive, she connected with an ex and planned a visit with him over a weekend she had originally told me you had open. She did this while I was home caring for sick sister, and going through work layoffs. When I most needed support, she seemingly went the opposite direction. Not to mention that she is an oncology nurse and my sister had nearly just died from cancer. If somehow she had the visit already planned and didn't say anything while we were getting serious at her request that is hardly better. 


Right before her ex (now fiance) arrived she suddenly backtracked on our relationship title. She ignored me when he visited, after assuring me multiple times that his visit would be low impact and easy. She Instagrammed herself and all her friends out with her, something she had told me I wasn't allowed to do. She even extended his visit and had him sleep in her room with her. 


After our breakup, right when I was healing, I saw her and him together on social media. They came up in my feed doing all the activities we had talked about doing. Skiing, hockey games, traveling, etc. I promptly removed her since she was ghosting me anyways, but the damage was done. 


She promised me she would never have feelings for him again (wrong religion, values, ect) and that nothing happened between them. But every action she took says otherwise.  The moment she decided to have him visit our relationship was over. I was too blinded by feelings and trust to see it, not to mention how fast she changed. 


Whatever the nature of the relationship is between them two, the fact that she put me in this position at all is cruel. It stains not only every moment we spent together, but also her relationship with with him, whatever form it takes. They knowingly hurt someone who's worst crime was being caught between them. A position she put me in. 


 When she  asked me to meet her family and go exclusive I told her that doing so meant we were serious about our relationship and each other. I made clear to her multiple times that I was in a place where I was especially susceptible to heartbreak and needed to be with someone good and trustworthy. She said she understood and that I could trust her. She even went further and said that she had rushed it before but this time ""she was  sure."" The situation I ended up in is the exact situation I asked her not to put me in when we had that talk, and when we talked about the conditions of his visit. 


She said when in a relationship you always work to give it 100%. I saw her give 100% to the other two men she dated around me, her friends, her family, and her patients at work. What I have had a hard time understanding is why I was and am seemingly the one exception.  It makes me feel like I don't deserve to be loved. 

To  not be worth a phone call or a cup of coffee when her last ex was so important he slept in her room during our relationship cuts deep. I truly believed that even if our romantic relationship was over we would be friends and supporters of each other. That was both the promise we made and the example she set. That is what people who really care about one another do. When we broke up we said we had a love for each other, even if our relationship didn't work. I thought we both meant it. 

 Her actions have impacted my ability to trust, give affection, and be vulnerable. That she could do all of the above, and more, after taking so much from me, and not feel any sympathy, empathy, or remorse is alien to me, and something I wish she could reflect on. She never directly acknowledged how hurtful or wrong any of your actions were. Even if just on the level of ""I see how you might feel this way, "" or took any form of responsibility. Even when I made clear I was not pursuing you romantically and tried to hear her side. She was reckless with my emotions and took advantage of my feelings. I did not deserve to be treated this way. 


She my person and I trusted her. I thought I had met the woman of my dreams. Smart, sassy, thoughtful. Someone I was happy to camp, go to weddings, on road trips, hikes, and to services with. Someone I could sit in a Mexican restaurant full of old people with and make laugh until they cried. To breakfast or ramen, or taking me to my first NFL game. Someone who really cared about and understood me. Someone who would use her 15-minute break at 2am to hide in an exam room and talk to me. Who cared about those in her life and had a good head on her. Who walked me to my car after meeting her family and kissed me and told me how much it meant. Who felt safe and brought light to my life. 


 It is one thing to quickly lose that connection, but then to question if it was real, be ignored, feel replaced, mislead, and manipulated, is just heartbreaking. No other relationship in my life, romantic or otherwise, has ever caused me such pain. To not write her now and give voice to that pain seems to me be the equivalent to giving her actions my approval and not standing up for myself. 

I hope wish she can find the maturity and empathy to listen to what I am saying and acknowledge what happened rather than use my words to marginalize or minimize me or what happened. I wish she would stop ghosting those who care for her even when they make her uncomfortable or are not of use to her, and have the confidence to face issues head-on to protect those who trust her. I hope she can find the courage to be clear and honest with people who are vulnerable to her and understand the impact her actions have. I hope that she can keep her promises to those who have love for her, or have the courage to not make them at all.",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,592701,public,confidence,self,My breakup broke me,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/es6wkr/my_breakup_broke_me/,no_ads,0.0

They're not there for me, but I still wanna try to be there for them. 
No one was there for me, even when I was young child. Even right now, I don't trust people.
I become so depressed after whenever I try to ""socialize"" with others, I always mess up and they probably think I am just shit, or a jerk.
It's hard to communicate and I am just considering to stop it all at once, it's better for me to close myself to prevent myself to become ""hurt"" again.

There's so many things I can't do without proper planning, but there's always time.
My time is running out and I have to maintain things to stay afloat, things are failing apart.

People only care of their personal happiness, unless it benefits them by either getting closer to an individual.
Everyone is using eachother, it is gains that matter.
I strive to try to be the opposite, but I am currently depressed and can't do anything.

Another vent post, my mental health is worsening by the day.
Time is running out, I can't pull off things to repair the ideal future I want.
I can't help those I want to help when I am like this,  I can't, I don't know how to say things, my conversations are dull and boring.
I never had an actual friend, they only want a ""good time"" from me, while I lie and pretend to enjoy it as well. I still try to, but it's getting progressively harder.
I am only being used, while none of my friends aren't there as I can't ask for help.
It's in my gut that they don't wanna, but they're all probably not miss me when I am finally done.

It makes me feel like I did something wrong and I’m a failure but nobody says anything about it. I used to feel so connected to everyone and now I feel like they don’t even know I exist. Or if they do, I feel like they have a grudge against me for some reason that I don’t know about. It’s stupid to base self worth off from likes but why does it make me feel so paranoid and pathetic? Maybe I’m just an attention seeker I don’t know. But there’s just something that’s entirely messed up about social media and how it has its ways of making you feel worthless. I’ve posted on Snapchat about how I felt suicidal one time during a breakdown and I feel like people have not wanted to associate with me ever since. It makes me feel pathetic for having tried to reach out to people when I was at my lowest. I’m someone who’s always there for people whenever they need it but it seems like nobody’s ever there for me. I just feel worthless and it feels like nobody gives a damn about me anymore. Or they are disgusted by me for having mental disorders. I don’t know what to do. I try so hard to stay positive and keep my problems to myself but it makes me feel terrible. I know that it’s more valuable to have a few close friends than a bunch of random followers but I feel like I don’t even have close friends anymore. Or that my semi-close friends are all sick of me. I’m just tired of feeling like there’s nobody out there who I can call a true friend anymore, or anyone in general who even cares about my existence. I’m paranoid because I feel like there are people who follow me just to criticize me. I don’t know. Maybe I’m overreacting but I just feel like deleting everything at this point.",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,592712,public,confidence,self,Self worth?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/es743i/self_worth/,no_ads,0.0

I'm sorry I wasn't what you wanted me to be. I'm sorry I wasn't. I wished more than anything that if I try harder, be better, everything could be good again. But it wasn't, and I wasn't.
I'm sorry I wasn't.

First, to you, mom. My curly-haired warrior, riding in every day on your noble steed--you're black stallion--to save me. Me. I'm sorry it wasn't enough. I'm sorry I wasn't enough. But when the darkness took me, when the black fog swarmed my thoughts, it took too far and I couldn't reach your hand anymore. I wish I could remember whst it felt like to hold your hand again; to be a child once again. But my innocence and light was stolen and I sit in the darkness. I'm sorry this darkness hid me from you. I wish you could have found me.

Then, to you, dad. You did your best with what you had. And when your father, your thief of innocence, your captor of all light, took your childhood, you had none to give me. But you tried your best. I'm sorry it wasn't enough. I'm sorry I wasn't enough. I wish I had met your standards, done what you had wished from me, listened to your wishes, but I fled them instead. For that, I am not sorry, but I am sorry that I didn't mean you any harm. I wish you knew how badly I needed to save myself.

To younger my sister, nearly my age. There are no words for me to give to you except, I'm sorry. Thinking of you without me makes my heart ache. Don't follow in my footsteps.

Oh older sister, I'm sorry we didn't get along. I wish I had know you more. I wish you had known me more.

My dearest brother, I hope you know I love you; I know you loved me.

After that, a lot of people stopped talking to me, but I still had friends and I was starting to become more happy. However, it all changed recently when there were rumours made up of me talking about raping girls and that I am a creep and a stalker. I have reported it to the police and all, but I need some tips from you guys on how to deal with this situation. I can’t confront the creator of the rumours since I do not know who is behind it all I know is that someone made an account that talked about me stalking and wanting to rape girls. I’m assuming the people who are doing this are doing it for fun since back in the situation before, the kid said that it was funny what was happening to me. I don’t know how to cope with this at school since high school is a tricky time where kids are very mean.  It will ruin my reputation and I will become almost a complete outcast because it’s a group of kids bullying me not just one but it’s one kid who’s controlling and causing them to do it.

I don’t know the day, what event triggered it, I don’t know at what point I started struggling to find a reason to have any motivation to do anything. All I know is that I wake up everyday not knowing how I’m going to spend the day, not finding a reason to do anything. I have the most incredible family and friends yet despite that I have mastered the ability of convincing myself that I’m alone. It’s like no matter how many people I have that care about me I don’t see any of that and convince myself I’m alone. I can’t seem to talk to any of them and I more often than not convince myself that people don’t like me. I take any form of criticism to heart and I think it’s because I already think of myself as being a nobody. I think of myself as being someone who’s kind and positive to other people but past that I think that I’m a pretty shitty person who’s just spiraling in nowhere. No matter how many resources I have available to help set myself on a better path I don’t have the strength or motivation to even reach for them. I can’t even speak out loud my own mind somehow, it’s easier to write it down. I am surrounded by love but somehow all I ever see is what I convince myself that everyone else has and what I don’t have. I feel as though my friends don’t care about me even though I know they do; I doubt everything I do. I haven’t done anything with any certainty in years. I’m lost and I don’t know how to find myself. I hear from my parents who absolutely love me that I need to find my way by doing things to improve myself, quitting nicotine, getting in shape, going back to school but I can’t for the life of me find any motivation in myself to do any of that. I view it all as something that I’d love to do but something that I can’t do. I give up on things and myself before I even start doing it. I don’t know why I’m this way. I think the last time I can remember being happy was with my Ex and even then, I think that’s because we were both broken people to a certain degree who somehow managed to click in some way. Somehow, I viewed her as someone I could talk to in a way, I couldn’t talk to anyone else with. It wasn’t the physical connection; it was the mental. While I had that, that was the happiest I had been in a long time and I don’t mean with some meaningless getting drunk with my buddies and finding happiness in something tangible I just was overall happy having someone that I felt completely open and not reserved with. After losing that I fell back into my spiral I was in before her, I managed to help her a lot but I never helped myself. Even though I have countless people in my life that I can be completely the same way with, I just don’t seem to be able to open up to them in the same way I could with her. I’ve always kept to myself except at times where my emotion has truly boiled over. I’ve never considered suicide and I don’t think that’s something that I would ever do but I have many times thought how it wouldn’t be that bad if I wasn’t here. I don’t think I’m a great person nor do I think I’ll have an incredible meaningful impact on the world. I view myself in the most negative light and I do it every day. I consistently seek validation from other people because I’ll never find it from myself. I live to make other people happy and smile because I like the idea of people thinking I’m a happy outgoing loving guy, but I can’t ever seem to find any self-love from myself. I can’t open up to my parents about this because I’m afraid they’ll see this side of me that I do my best to hide and just see me a someone pathetic and broken for no reason. Because I am, I don’t have any reason to feel the way that I do, yet I do. I don’t live a bad life, I have friends, family, a home, and endless love yet I cannot seem to grasp any of that to any degree. I just want to wake up and feel happiness within that which I’m doing. But I can’t because I know that I don’t know what I’m doing and that I’m not doing anything good in my life. I need to improve myself, but I don’t know how. I don’t know when or why I started feeling this way, nor do I know if I’ll ever be able to even say this out loud to anyone. I’ve even convinced myself in this situation that It’s no one else’s problem that I feel the way that I do, it’s my own problem that I need to fix on my own, but I need to find a way to move past that and accept the resources that are around me. I need to be open to medication. I need to be open to change no matter how much that scares me, I just need to be. I’m not sure how I’ll be able to and I’m sure it won’t be a fast process, but I can do it. I just need to make the leap. Thank you for reading my rant of my truth. This is the first time I've ever said anything about the way that I feel and the first time that I've actually acknowledged the way that I feel. I don't know if anyone else feels this same way but I figured I'd might find one or two people who understand where I am and could maybe give me any kind of guidance on what I can do to help myself.

No one helped me in those 10 years, not her children, my cousins or any family, i was my own and i hate them for it. That experience made me realize how little faith I have in people. I have no motivation to speak to people or interact to people as a result. 

I go to work because I have to have a job, I have a lot of debt from all the years I didn’t work caring for my grandma and school, a debt I don’t want my family to inherit if I was to kill myself.

It’s stayed true and it’s haunting me.

Nowadays it feels incredibly difficult not to feel ungrateful when I hate myself. I’ve always done well academically but never quite well enough. Always had at least two Bs tarnishing what could’ve been a 4.0. I’ve always been tall (just under 6’4) but not quite tall enough for whatever I wanted to do, basketball or dating or whatever it was. I’ve grown more into my looks but just not well enough, and now it’s not that I’m unattractive but every part of my body is just 2% below what it needs to be, so I couldn’t model, I couldn’t date the girl, I couldn’t get a picture good enough, it just wasn’t enough.

I’ve always slipped to second or third place no matter what it is, always passed up by a centimeter for someone else just slightly better. My hair isn’t quite curly enough, my style isn’t quite good enough, the essay wasn’t quite eloquent enough, I’m always so infuriatingly close yet just a bit too far away and it’s eaten away at my confidence for years and now I just can’t take it.

On any social media I post on I never get any of the attention or likes or followers other people do. I can work out three times a week minimum for hours on end and never gain any muscle. I can study for hours and get good enough to be passing even getting an A but I’ll never be the kid setting the curve. I have no particular talents or redeeming qualities and at this point I have no friends. I’m never the cutest boy in the room. I’m so tempted to give up and give in to the hopelessness and just do the bare minimum and stop trying but I feel like the vain hope that I could one day be good enough is all that’s keeping me from killing myself. I’ve been trying to resist for so long. I’m so ready to let go and just die, I have nothing left and no people who would be significantly upset by my passing.

I’ve lost all of my close friends at this point. My best friend is completely self absorbed in their own many problems and we see each other virtually never. All of my other close friends have deserted me purposefully all saying similar things along the lines of “I don’t like you or want to be apart of your life anymore”, the last thing of significance one of them said to me was that she was just waiting for me to inevitably commit suicide. It feels as though I waste my days looking for fulfillment for no reason at all. I’m so tired of all of this. I’m waiting for a good enough reason to kill myself every day. I applied to the great colleges and didn’t get in, but I got into a moderate university. I accepted and I don’t want to go anymore, not because I’m not sure of my life or career path. I’m certain of what career I want and I know I could get to it, but I don’t want to go through with life in general anymore.

The day that I last attempted suicide my father asked me if I well and truly, soberly, when not in the heat of the moment, wanted to die. I told him no but I lied. I’m more certain that I want to die than anything else at all. I feel so ungrateful for what I have but I’m so overcome with despair because it isn’t what I want and neither is anything I could really get throughout my life. I want to leave. I don’t know what to do.

The weird part is I have friends I talk to and even friends online I talk to as well, but even with talking I find myself feeling sad and lonely. I’m 27yrs old male with no girlfriend I have a decent job and currently living with family. Although I have a rocky relationship with my step-father. Him and I don’t see eye to eye on everything and tend to argue from time to time. 

I also feel when I’m around people I always try to be cheerful and joyous even when I’m not 100% feeling that way because I don’t like seeing others sad because I’ve known that feeling for far too long. And with me being so uplifting and joyful all the time I tend to never get taken seriously. People see me as a jokester always cracking jokes and never see anything more.

Which ends up to me being the butt of everyone’s joke. After awhile it gets old.

~~~~~~~~

Dear everyone,

If I live, destroy this, dont show anyone, but in case that wish isnt respected, then put me in a mental hospital, away from my parents, I'd rather not want to see them.

If I die, then show my friends and family.

To my friends, for now R and H. I'm sure you will make great parents, I'm sure you two know what to do from the mistakes of your own parents, hopefully my own, dont repeat the cycle. Sorry I pestered you H, about being the Godmother and all, I like to think I have a future with my friend. I hope you two choose a great name, sorry I pestered you about names and with my list, I hope it was useful.

Mom. My god were you toxic. You might think you're an amazing mom, but look at me. Look at your fuck up of a daughter. You and your washed up sperm donor who you kept bitching about made this. You may have given me what I wanted, but not fucking once what I NEEDED. I tried to fucking talk to you, but you always fucking shut me down, saying I have no fucking reason to be depressed. How its my *fault*. Well fuck you. Its *your* fault. You're fault you made a shitty decision to live out in the middle of fucking now where to raise my older siblings G and D when your gold digger boyfriend at the time offered to buy you a nice house in the city, where you then had to give them up because you couldnt give them basic necessities to raise them, making you miss them grow up. Its you're fault you let that sperm donor make you have kids when you knew it wasnt the right time, who knows, things would have been better. Honestly, my teachers give me better support because they deal with kids my age on a daily fucking basis, unlike you where you just sit on your ass and bitch about the world. You would bitch about me not ""projecting"" enough, ever fucking thought it was because I was actually suffering? Of course not, that honors in high school and in community college in arts doesnt make you intelligent. It was also that fucking bitch in headstart, who fucked with my head somehow just because I liked to play by myself.  

Dad. Not as bad as mom, but you're still shitty for trying to leave us and lie about it, ruin holidays that brought good memories. Even now, trying to force something on me when I told you plenty of fucking times I will on join the JWs. If you're trying to fix what you broke, then please fucking stop.

My brother A, please be a good dad, take her to Disneyland.

Teachers A and M, thanks for trying to help. You guys were good. 

(Area is for my stuff, not interesting)

Sorry again, that this happened. I guess I couldn't wait long. I guess the social worker was just a sweet lie then. I also couldnt wait for ww3, the plague, economic depression, all that jazz.

Well then seeya later in hell, peace.

I’ve always had a problem socializing, expressing myself and trying to understand the motives of others. This past year and a half, just about, I embarked on a journey to better myself. To learn how to socialize, to get out there and learn to work, to be active, and to make friends.

And you know, something? I’ve learned that I have no problem working, no issue with being active, but no matter what the fuck I try to do, I can’t make friends. I just can’t relate to other people. And this isn’t due to lack of trying...

Right now, I’ve got a full time job and am going to school full time. I’m trying to cut back my hours at my current job so that I can work a few hours as an English tutor at my college. I’m being more active on Reddit and social media - I’m getting myself hobbies, like learning Korean and 3D Animation. And yet, I still feel empty. I still can’t connect with other people. At the end of the day, everything that I’ve done so far, alll of this, still doesn’t matter...

I was speaking with my therapist the other day, telling him how, idk, something to the degree of I felt like I was still missing something, or something like that. I don’t fully remember- I was unpacking a few things with him that day. Well, we got to the point where he asked me what I wanted right now - what would make me happy, or what I expected from the people around me (again, don’t really remember what he asked me exactly, but that was more or less the gist of it...)

And I told him that I wanted someone to “hold me accountable.” If I were to die tomorrow, it’s not that people wouldn’t miss me. No, my parents and siblings all love me - I know that. It’s irrational to think that they wouldn’t feel some form of sorrow or grief. No, I don’t want to “feel like I’m loved”. Even though at times I may not feel it, I know that these people are people in my life that, if I tried to commit suicide, they’d push the trigger as far away from my head as possible and put it as much effort into doing so as possible.

No, what I want is, when I get home from working a 12 hour shift, or after having spent 13hours at school and on the road, I want someone to notice and to miss me. I want someone to want me. I want someone that, when I get home, they’d ask how I feel and how my day went. And I’d want them to care.

I want someone to hold me accountable to, if nothing else, just them.

My family, they love me, I know they do.  But they could go a couple days without hearing from me and not blink an eye. They’d care if I killed myself, don’t get me wrong, but the meantime, while I’m still alive, not much else is honestly going on between me and them.

I  don’t know. I guess I’m just saying this cuz, I realized, no matter how much shit you do, how much effort and hard work you put into your life, at the end of the day, when you’re alone in your room and about to go to bed, you can still feel that gnawing emptiness that just won’t go away.

It just sucks that, I’m honestly doing all of this, and I’ve gotten so much better in the last year from where I used to be, and yet, I still feel nothing. 

Nothing has really changed, at the end of the day...

Damn I don't even know what I want. 

I don't know if I'm depressed. By all accounts of my own research and experiences talking to therapists etc I feel like I am but have never had anything confirmed. 

I contemplate my existence regularly. I self-deprecate constantly and struggle to find any reason that anyone would want/need me around. I seriously feel like I have no purpose in life other than to exist (real NPC vibes). I understand that I have some level of meaning to people, but I can't seem to sustain a healthy relationship with anyone for more than about a year. My parents have ""kicked me out"" of home and then welcomed me back within a few months several times over the last 5 years. My brother wants hardly anything to do with me (unless he wants a favour) despite us actually having a lot of shared interests. I'm currently living with my partner of two years, but some days I'm not sure she even wants to be with me. Instead I sometimes feel like she's with me because if she leaves me I'll have no one. Many of my ""friends"" rarely contact me and if something is gonna be organised it's almost always me doing the work and they only really hang out with me if there is other people around making me feel like they're there to be around the other guys, not me. My grades at university are fairly mediocre despite me putting in WAY too much effort (masters of architecture) and we're worse in my previous degree (health science) and it makes me feel like I don't really have any valuable assets to contribute to life. I bounce from hobby to hobby to keep myself occupied in my life, but often find myself losing interest within 6 months. Like some, I only feel ""happy"" when I take drugs and that's about it (both licit and illicit). 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I've tried the whole ""finding yourself"" thing but I can't seem to do it.

Sorry if what I am going to say is confusing because English is not my first language. 
I was hospitalized on November 21,2019 because I had a panic attack at school and they called 911. I was discharged on Nov 24 and I was diagnosed with MDD, anxiety disorder with panic attacks, cluster B personality traits, social phobia. I'm an international student (I'm living in Canada), and I do have insurance. 
But the thing is, the process takes forever and I'm going crazy! After many days, the hospital has been sending 3 letters, calling me and asking me to pay the bill as soon as possible. The last one was sent to my new house last Sunday. They said it was their final notice. My boyfriend was the one who contacted the insurance company since the first day I was in the hospital until now. The company was completely quiet after we sent them all the medical records that we received. I just tried to contact them and email them last 3 days and after 2 days, their response was "" Your claim is still under review by the Claims Department. "". 2 hours later, they sent me an email and ask me to send them tons of medical records/notes from the hospital in Canada and Vietnam (my home) BEFORE FEB 19. It drives me crazy because I'm going home soon (Jan 25 to Feb 15) and I tried to contact them SO MANY TIMES but they didn't say anything. 
There is also another problem that my 1 of 3 psychiatrists wrote that I was hospitalized in Vietnam in 2017 (which is a misunderstanding, I only told him that I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist back in 2017). When I told the insurance company the truth, it seems like they didn't really care because it was written on the actual paper. 
My friend had a same case with me and they refused to pay the bills for her because ""she already had those mental illnesses before she came to Canada"". $8000 is a way too big amount of money to my family rn. I have been having so many bad days since the first day of 2020, exams are coming in a day and thinking of all these shits drive me crazy.

If you read this, thank you.

I've had a very bad past few years. I failed out of college because I'm young and stupid and did not take it seriously enough, ruining my chances at achieving my dreams. After that, I became incapable of making any good decisions. It's not like I don't understand that they are wrong, but in the moment I seldom realize what I've done.

A couple years ago I also developed a health issue. One that is embarrassing and has utterly ruined my confidence. This issue has also resulted in a lot of surgery. I have had four surgeries, broken up by long periods of recovery where I should not be on my feet. I almost fear love right now, because I am a coward. I know I shouldn't be, I don't want to be, but I am.

That said, I ignored the doctors advice during recovery the first two times. Not entirely ignored it, but didn't follow it to the T, you know? This may have contributed to my failure to heal each time, but it's a bummer to think you're a fool. That said, the last two times I have followed there instructions fully and still haven't healed, so maybe I've been cursed. I've grown to hate myself quite a bit.

I've also lost a lot of friends recently. I feel like I was targeted, that I've done nothing wrong, but I wonder if that's just because I'm a bad person. I've thought about that a lot recently. Like, maybe I just have this huge ego, and that's why everyone hates me. Maybe my ego is what made me make this post. Whether it really is my fault or not, it sucks.

I do still have one good friend and smoking marijuana has helped me a bit. It can pull me out of an episode sometimes.

If anything I could use some advice from anyone of you out there who may connect with what I’m about to lay down.

So I got the flu and spent the first 5 days in bed, too sick to get up, to eat, to sleep, to smoke weed (I was a heavy pot smoker), to watch tv, everything. I think I only ate a few apples and some chicken soup. 
The next about 5-7 days as the physical symptoms (coughing, puking, headaches; just to name the worst if them) started to subside I felt an overwhelming force of depression, sadness and fatigue. More acutely than ever. (And I had had a rough couple of years before that.)
So I decided to make a change, I began to take better care of myself. I cut back my smoking about 99% (out of necessity because of the cough) and began eating probiotics and taking vitamins. One night I had a long talk with some friends and we shared old stories that made me laugh harder than I had in a long time. I woke up the next morning a new me. I was happier and more energetic. It's been about 5 days of feeling this way as I write this right now and I want to keep up this momentum. I was talking to a friend today and he convinced me to get a gym membership, I am more motivated than ever and will go tomorrow to do it because it's my day off.  I really feel like I'm on the right path and have found the real me, I've been more honest and open with my feelings in the last 5 days. I've been more personable and confident. I want to share this success with everyone I can, and show them that anyone can be happy if they put their minds to it. There will always be trials and times of sadness in everyone life but it doesn't have to last for ever. 
In conclusion its seems to me that this happiness won't last forever either but you will know when you are on the right path and when you are keep going, it gets exponentially better.

I don't *technically* have depression. I have bipolar type 2 disorder. Both sides of my family have a history and I also have anxiety disorder more than likely from my father who was on Xanax at 14 years of age. I have been clinically diagnosed with these disorders by a doctor and a professional psychiatrist, yet being told what my problems are doesn't exactly assist in helping me deal with them. Now that that's out of the way....

My bipolar makes me mood swingy as hell. I can go from being perfectly fine, to being so angry I make my knuckles bleed hitting the nearest inanimate object, to crying on the ground so hard I can't breathe and I have to hit my inhaler. Of course I try not to let anyone see any of this shit because I'm a ""man,"" right. Gotta fucking man up and be a man and not show any pain or any of that bullshit. I can't fucking confide in anyone because they think I'm a fucking joke. A pathetic piece of weak filth, a sad excuse of a human, and a fucking waste of oxygen. And shit, at this point they may be right. I'm so sick of everything. I'm sick of being looked down upon, for being seen as inferior, for being treated like a second class fucking organism. 

I'm pissed off at myself, the world, my friends, my family, my coworkers, my peers at school, everything. I'm so angry all the time and all I can do is bury it. I push it down, blast metal music in my ears, hit things when no one's around, hurt myself in places people can't see to relieve something SOME KIND OF FUCKING RAGE. I wanted my opportunities at school by squandering my intelligence and dropping out. Had to climb up the ladder and get my GED and in the process damage my college potential which I'm now suffering for. I wasted my youth drowning myself in my hobbies, games, anime etc not building any meaningful fucking talents or any useful skills other than being mildly okay at singing and wasting the oxygen I breathe. I have no good or interesting talents. I'm as fucking bland as white bread. 

I'm barely making it. Working full time, living paycheck to paycheck, trying to make school work as well so I can ""get a better job and have a better life,"" or whatever stupid fucking Boomer shit my family spews to me. They laugh when I tell them what I actually want to do with my useless fucking existence as it's unconventional but literally the only thing I could see my worthless self being good at. Everything seems fucking pointless and I've fallen down this rabbit hole before. If I hit the bottom I don't know if I really want to try and make it back out again. I honestly don't know if life, in particular my life, is worth all the trouble and fighting to maintain. Maybe it's better to just call this shit here. I don't know anymore. 

I'm so lonely. I have friends and people I genuinely care about but it only helps so much. It's like sometimes I'm stuck on my own little island helpless, while my friends stand on the mainland reaching to me with no reasonable way to get to me. I have no intimacy in my life. I've only had one semi serious relationship and it never got that physical. I feel unwanted, ignored, like trash on the ground. I'm just so sick of all of it honestly. At this point I'm just..... tired. Tired of all the anger, sadness, bullshit, lies, pain, all of it. I'm ready to just sleep, maybe permanently at this point. I just... don't know anymore.

Right now I'm taking a course that's a month long and the first week I was normally hanging out with the people (that I don't know) just being myself but after their other troll friends came and I felt my freeze and a few days later I started to sense that they are trolling and mocking me... I hate making trouble and violence so I try to be nice and kind maybe sometimes just laugh but I'm just tired of being like this. I've been into several situations before where the second I feel like I'm being laughed or mocked at I just stop functioning and start thinking of how to get out of this situation and how to befriend these people cause everytime I get into these situations I feel like the other person is always superior and knows how to act and is better than me... I really want to have fun and socialize but I just can't with this limits I feel I have...

Class clown kid, not so good grades (didn’t care about school unless I wanted to), and liked a lot by peers. I’ve been thinking about suicide since around the age of 12. I’ve always said from then on that I wouldn’t make it past 25 (sometimes jokingly but most of the time seriously) I’m currently 20, and as the years gone by, I think about ending my life a lot. Sometimes out of the blue, something would remind me of a way for myself to die. People care about me....a lot. People like my honesty, my humor, my attitude towards goals and as well as my creativity. I don’t really like to hang out with people, I’d prefer being completely alone and on my phone or watching something than to be around most people, but I’m sure this is attributed to my depression. I don’t talk to people on my phone or anything other than in person. I have no contacts saved, so answering the phone is always a mystery. I don’t know why but a lot of people call me their friends despite me not feeling bonds at all anymore. I don’t like having friends or any sort of connection to other people anymore. (yeah, I’m a conversation carrier 🤦🏿‍♂️) I’m extremely introverted but in a social setting I’m a full fledged extrovert who can talk to anyone about anything because I have excellent social skills. (It’s hard to explain if you don’t understand but I could) I’ve disappointed both of my parents and I’m very sure they think I’m a bad person, but still their child so they kinda put up with me. My mother tries and I acknowledge that although  she wasn’t the best mother at all, I can tell she’s trying to change for me. I think it would be better if I didn’t affect her life anymore. I have 4 siblings and I’m the oldest. I don’t hold a strong bond with anyone and it’s kinda always been like that. I wish I never existed to essentially to be a fuck up to my mom tho. I’m very much considering buying a gun of my own. The reason I bring this up is because a Friend of mine today called my phone earlier and he told me about a gun he got and wanted to shoot with me (couldn’t go cuz of work) I know how to get my hands on a gun for at least $200. Idk, my dreams seem a bit far fetched, I’m not happy most of the time. Just a lot going wrong right now and from the past as well. Not a very bright future I see for myself either. I think it would best to end my life before this ticking time bomb explodes or before I realize myself I don’t have anything more to offer (personally). I lived a good life tho.

This prolly sounds so self-centered, since I hate myself with a passion. You know those people who seem to get along with each other. Hanging out, reaching out, spending a great deal of time together, etc. I reckon those kind of friendships only happen in films or books, but not really. Sometimes, I get so incredulously tired of making the first move, even the simplest thing like asking someone to hang out. Not gonna lie, I always feel so left out. This might not be what my friends was intending for, but I've been feeling. Sometimes, thise feeling can lead you to wander what’s the best option to solve this loneliness. I gotta be honest that I've been thinking about suicide and specific ways to accomplish that. It's not like everyone would notice anyway. My mom told me several weeks ago that it was a big mistake to have me in the first place. I couldn't really blame her cause I get her reason behind it. I'm not a bright or clever kid. I'm not someone who's parents would be proud of. I have accomplished nothing. I have earned nothing. Last night, I talked to some people on this sub reddit. I wanted to be their friends and now they don't even reply to my messages. Kinda same with my pals in real life. They got to hang out a lot without me.

I have felt this way since my sophomore year of high school. I’m 19 now. It all started when I got a girlfriend whose family was really religious, and she didn’t share the same beliefs as her parents. After a month of us dating we started doing more than kissing, but we never had sex. One day her parents took her phone and saw everything we talked about. Her parents immediately called the cops and claimed rape because “their daughter wouldn’t disobey their religion like this.” The cops saw consenting messages between me and said ex. I didn’t get charged, but I got put on a year on a weird kind of probation. A few weeks later the “popular-drama” girl in the school heard about it. From that point until my graduation day I got called a rapist and a pedophile (even though we were the same age) 

A week after graduation I moved out of the state into a city. I found a job and new friends. I was just starting to enjoy everything when I find out my parents are getting a divorce. My mom starts going anorexic and my dad gets suicidal. I quit my job and haven’t talked to my friend since so I can stay with my dad and make sure he doesn’t feel alone. 

After me staying with him for a week, he gets drunk and decided he wanted to fight. We got into it while I was trying to calm him down. He then kicks me out of the house. I just quit my job and sold my apartment lease. I have nothing. I am nothing. I took the 200 dollars I had and drove to my grandpas 10 hours away. I have no money and they have no idea what’s going on. I have nothing to go home too... better yet I have no home.. I feel so close to ending everything.

So, lately I’ve been feeling really down. A event occurred that I’d rather not speak about, making me feel like shit.  Something similar had happened in the past and so it affected me more this time. I’m a character approver in a RP server I’m in on discord and i made a big fuck up and the co owner went off on me.  I’m honestly really sad and dont want to do anything anymore.

I haven’t really been motivated to do anything and I’ve tried talking to friends to make myself feel better and it hasn’t worked.  

I’m afraid that since I’m apart of the younger group of people everyone’ll say that “its just a phase!” or “You’re too young to have depression or be depressed!” Its all overwhelming.  Also to add more to my plate, ive been trying to do better for myself this year, but alas i look like shit and my mental health is even worse, my grades are lowering and not getting better.  

Also, I’ll confess. I’ve wanted to commit suicide. I may be young but that doesn’t mean I’m not suicidal. I looked at one of the kitchen knifes and thought, what if i stab myself in the neck with that? It’ll make all the pain go away. I also have really dark thoughts, were I look at someone or something and visualize something happening that’s really bad. An example was when I was holding a stick and had a vision of me doing something not very good with it to another person.

As men we're taught to ignore the pain. Fight through it. Ignore your feelings or you're not a man. I want to cry. Truly I do, but even as I sit here with tears welling up, part of me is preventing me from feeling the emotion - and I mean truly feeling the emotion my heart tells me I should be feeling.   


It's been this way for a while. I want to do things with my spare time. I don't even know what I'm passionate about. I usually just end up either doing nothing or listening to music. I don't have any talents. The friends I have either only talk to me when they need something or they're drunk. I sit at home after work and do nothing. I buy things and I get so excited about them but when I have them I never use them. I used to get so excited. Now I just... I dunno. I've finally hit a point in my life where it's unclear if that the things I want are even possible. Coming to terms with it may be the hardest part.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's the other part of me. ""You haven't even tried."" I tell myself that over and over, but I never do anything. It's all just a big loop. Wake up. Work. Do nothing. Sleep. Do it again.   


What even is the point? I wish I knew.

This will be a convoluted mess I am sincerely sorry for wasting your time.

I realized around the new year that how I've always felt isn't really ""normal"" (always saying I hate myself, calling myself an idiot, etc) so I really started paying attention to how I felt everyday.

I realized I feel awful all the time but I just always feel like I'm some whiny attention seeking edgelord anytime I want to talk to someone about it. I don't have any reason to be depressed and I don't act like a depressed person. I get good grades, I go out with friends, I read comics every now and then, etc. Not really things I'd be doing if I were depressed.

I mean it is hard for me to get out of bed and do anything most days (I mean there isn't really a reason to anyway) and when I'm out with my friends I have ""fun"" but I do also just sit there very tired repeating I hate myself in my head or wanting to die but still. Not really like I've lost interest in my hobbies or anything; on the rare occasion I'll decide to turn on my switch or PC and play a game and not sit and stare at my library for hours I just end up getting so frustrated with everything or overwhelmed. A 3d platformer I get overwhelmed with the stuff on screen to collect or in FPS I get frustrated at how I much I suck and upset how everyone on my team probably hates me for every mistake I make, just as an example. I also rarely find it easy to read comics or books I am supposed to love without being really bored or frustrated about nothing. Idk I'm just stupid. The point is how I feel worries me that I may need help but I realize I'm probably just being a whiny bitch.

In my studies I know I'm an idiot and a total fake. I'm a history major and I plan on being a teacher (terrible choice I know, that's what everyone tells me) but I don't know shit about it. All my knowledge is just basic stuff about American history and some modern European history. People younger than me are out there being able to name all these battles and stuff while I can barely remember stuff I just studied or have been studying for years. Even the periods I like to study just show how much of a loser I am, liking 1800s America and WW1 and not medieval Ottoman history or whatever. Not anything someone who actually would want to be a historian would know.

The biggest thing that makes me think I'm just being an attention whore is my urges to self harm. All I've ever heard is that it's something people do for attention without actually killing themselves. I even feel like I'm faking these dark thoughts because I'm too afraid of blood and pain to follow up on them.

I'll probably regret posting this later on.

I feel like everything around me is slowly coming apart at the seams. The few friends I've had have decided to distance themselves from me due to a recent auto accident that put me in the hospital for a little. I loved that car I had but unfortunately it's been totaled. having almost everyone I know excluding my brother go on about how I need to cheer up and seem more positive I just can't. The few friends i've got left have decided to take my fuck up and use it as a punch line to his jokes among other things. It just seems like people only befriend me because im someone to laugh at. I feel like this has happened to nearly all of my friendships, both online and offline. 

I feel like the people I've tried to make friends with only see me as a punch line in a joke rather than someone who genuinely just wants to hangout, and have a good time. Instead of that I'm used as a punchline. someone to point and laugh at, someone that isn't really apart of the group, a hangaround who makes more and more mistakes that someone can get a quick laugh out of. Someone who trusts to easily and regrets even opening up to people. I've been told I need to open up more by my peers. But every time I do so I'm met with dismissal about how Im over reacting, and how I need to suck it up and roll with the punches. 

I'm not sure if Im just broken but i feel like disconnecting from reality for a bit.

-I started group therapy. It’s amazing, hard, and weird all at once. I highly recommend it. So now I’m going to therapy twice a week— once with my personal therapist too. When I start to feel bad, therapy usually gives me the space to vent and then I don’t carry it with me the rest of the week. 

-I quit my antidepressant (Trintellix). It was really helpful for getting me to speak up in therapy and reducing anxiety, but once I was able to break my wall of silence it wasn’t doing much for me after that.

-I got a cat. He’s awesome. I love everything about having him. Even cleaning up after him because it gives me a way to take out my anxious energy. 

- I’ve been exercising. Not *that* much more than usual, but a little bit more and I’ve been consistant at least.

- I got a “happy light” (light therapy)  and am taking vitamin D every day. I got my blood tested and it turned out that I was slightly under my recommended amount of vit D.

I'm not looking for dating advice because I'm not an incel I am confident in my self to find someone, it's just this girl, I wanna be with her but she constantly wants to be alone or something, almost intrested with working with teachers and a few of her friends, shes a  quite person, but I love her. But fuck it whatever your just gonna say shes not intrested, or respect her space, because all people do is shrug there shoulders at me and recite there bullshit political pronoun shit till they kill themselves.

I have responsible I get straight Bs in school I do my work on time, I take care of my Pets, in the morning and afternoon I change there food and water and I talk to them, I value them there almost the reason I haven't pulled the trigger (metaphor) just to end it all. I complain and they listen, I bet your gonna say oh it's all good, developing a positive relationship with your pet or whatever, or your just a psycho that can take criticism, or your just a moody teenager, but..maybe your right.

They talk over me alot I try to talk but they just ignore me, I dont consider them friends anymore, one of my closest friends has a leftist God Complex randomly defending anything no matter the absurdity but Ironically hates furrys which makes it enjoyable, he is close but he's narcissism makes me wanna like leave, but he has a similar go get em attitude to me, maybe that's why I dont dislike him. I have another friend he's tremendously more open minded than the previous, we talk, we debate and conclude like functioning members of society which dont result to tribalism, one is just I'm not even sure how to describe him, friend one hates him, but he is a bit of a degenerate, but that would be hypocritical. But anyways all you need to know is they talk over me, I tried all the advice people gave me yet nothing worked, I know it requires patience but damn 4 months is alot of time. Tell me am I wrong for feeling like this? Or just existing in general? Can I love her? Can I abandon them? Can I die? What happens if I die? No one will give a shit? Oh he died of what a shame he was a good kid there was no sighn of hi- BULLSHIT. Will she love me? 



















No? I thought so. If I dont become active for more than a few months than you know what happened, you could investigate through my profile but I dont think it will get you anywhere though.

One of the craziest stories of my life. 
I've never really been a believer in God. I've always struggled with it even until this day. I don't fully believe, I don't fully not believe, I'm somewhere in the middle. No one truly knows. 

Anyways I'm 20 now and this story took place Freshman year when I was 14. I just got my heart broken for the first time, right after I lost my V card to her so it hurt even worse. That wasn't why I wanted to commit suicide, I think it just threw me into my yearly winter depression. 

I was sitting there with a belt around my neck. Robin William's had just passed by doing the same thing, and absolutely adored the man. I took one last chance. I prayed one last time. Thinking it was all bullshit, and still not knowing if it is.

I said ""Dear Lord, if theres a reason I need to be here or whatever please show me"" something along those lines. Tears rolling down my face, screaming at the world from the pain I was in when... ring ring. My phone goes off. 

This girl Named Ashley at school, very pretty popular girl, was giving me a call. Someone I very rarely talked to. She goes ""Hey, just thought you should know you're a really sweet person."" And just was saying super nice things. I never posted anything on social media, so there was really no way she would know anything was wrong. I thought someone put her up to it at first, but I brought it up to her Senior year since we were leaving. 

No one put her up to it. It came right after I asked for a sign. And either coincidence or a higher power, fucking something dude... idk what but that girl saved my life that day. 

That was just a really big wake up call that I wasn't so alone and I wasn't as judged as much as I judged myself. I think the thing that really cured it was magic mushrooms, although that's not for everyone, but for a surprisingly big amount.

I’m in college and on academic probation as a junior because I’m just barelyy passing when I used to be a straight A student in high school. I can’t regulate my sleep schedule, I’ve honestly tried so many ways to get out of bed and go to school but have literally just been skipping because of early classes. Now I’m taking later classes so I can at least go and try to succeed.

I feel like I have all this buried emotion and pain and when I let it come to the surface it really actually hurts. I don’t want to blame my depression on anyone but I’ve been hurt so many times by people who were supposed to be my friends and family and it has completely damaged my ability to trust. For this reason I have a harder time making new friends then I used to, because I don’t honestly want to waste my time and energy for someone who’s going to hurt me anyway.

Please forgive the wall of text. I'm feeling very hopeless and I need to express myself; this is my first post. Thanks for reading.  


When I think of myself, I think of a very stupid person. I think of a person who has a hard time expressing himself and a hard time grasping difficult concepts. I’d like to be curious and clever, but instead I tend to vegetate my life away, and my thoughts move slowly, if at all. I’m more interested in the idea of myself being perceived as a smart person than I am in actually learning.   


This is partially because, no matter how I try, I simply can’t seem to understand things in their full complexity. I can read a sentence a dozen times and still not understand. In the instance that I do eventually understand, I very quickly forget. It's like no progress was made at all. I become frustrated and give up, then I go to my bed to wallow in pity about how useless I am, and how unlucky I am to have been born with my second-rate mind.   


I’m 27 years old, and I look back on my life as a long series of embarrassments. Social cues are often lost on me and there’s a lot that goes over my head. Conversations happen in front of me and I’m lucky if I can keep up with what’s being said, let alone participate. When any sort of nuanced subject comes up, be it politics, art, philosophy, or just simple instructions, my eyes glaze over. I can pretend that I’m understanding but it soon becomes clear that I’m falling behind. Flirting is hard for me because I have trouble breaking past the surface of the literal and into all the subtext that’s required. I can tell that people feel sorry for me.   


It’s painful to not understand. It’s painful to not be able to express myself. It’s painful to not be able to participate. I’m always worried that people will take advantage of me because I know that many of them could if they had the mind. I close myself off emotionally out of defense and intellectually by default.

In high school I took for granted how easy it was for me to find a girlfriend or some friends to talk to or hang out with. I was in a relationship every year I was in high school and I had very toxic traits as a boyfriend such as jealousy, overly-clingy, etc. but after practicing meditation I have cleaned myself up and have put it to the test with relationships after. I don’t mean this in a cocky way or anything like that please don’t take it that way, but I would like to think im a good looking, nice, friendly, loyal guy.

However, I feel like every girl I try to talk to now or get to know, I fail now. Every single time. I’ve even had a time where this girl and I were talking (pre-dating stage) for a very long time, like over a year on and off, and she would lead me on, tell me how she wants a relationship with me, how great of a boyfriend I would be fot her, all for her to just to randomly get obsessed with her ex from years ago or get in a party/one night stand mood and tell me she doesn’t want a relationship and go to some other dude. I move on from these situations and don’t go back or dwell, but I’ve had so many rejections or failures in the past 2 years that they start to add up and really take a toll on me. 

I always try to love myself, tell myself that it’s ok to be single and that something will work out eventually we’re only 19 turning 20 and then I’ll fail again... and again... and again... sometimes I’ve even failed with people who used to really want me not even a year ago and that hits hard. I always make sure to treat the person I’m talking to very well, be a good person, respect their space and privacy, understand that dating doesn’t mean changing someone’s life — but rather just add happiness to it. Meanwhile, these girls are going for guys who cheat on them, make them leave all their guy friends in the past, treat them horribly!? I just don’t understand.

And to top it all off, I feel like my friends take me for granted as if they assume I’m going to be on earth every day as if something bad couldn’t happen to me in a flash. I always make sure to check on them, see how they’re doing, offer advice, someone to talk to,  help them find girlfriends or jobs, but I haven’t received a “how’s everything going?” once from someone in I dont know how long. My friends just choose when they want to be nice and respond to texts or do stuff, and when they randomly want to take their problems out on myself and friends and ignore us or outcast one another. 

I absolutely feel like I have nobody and that I have nobody at a stage in life where I should have plenty of friends or a girlfriend having the time of my life. Meanwhile, I feel like I waste away everyday... meditating and religion has kept me strong for awhile but I feel like I am breaking down and negativity is overcoming me on the nights I really realize I have nobody.",True,False,,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,592773,public,confidence,self,"Struggling with loneliness, feel like I am hopeless in a time I should be having the time of my life",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/es9egs/struggling_with_loneliness_feel_like_i_am/,no_ads,0.0

Bad things would happen and I would make a meme out of it. I really wasnt really aware of what I did back then. I cant even remember. It started with faking it but it seems like I 'made it'. I was happy. In a Joker way but not angry or agressive. I cant even really explain. This went on to 9th grade where I actually did got a bit more agressive. I felt that and I wanted to change it. I wanted to have good grades again. It was the time I slowly started to realize that I had missed some things on the way. Important things. I got tired of my friends (I even wonder how I had some). I didnt wanted everything to go bad again so I decided to switch schools (wich was the worst decision of my life but thats another story).

Due to posting for University, I have had to make a new Reddit account (hence my low karma), but I am looking to gain participants to complete my dissertation survey for my final year of University.

I am a Psychology student and the dissertation is on the effect sleep disturbances on mental health (including anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviours).

There is a mass of evidence showing how taking part in studies on mental health is beneficial for those who are suffering (Gibson, Boden, Benson, &amp; Brand, 2014, Wong, Kwok, Michel, &amp; Wong, 2017), it has also been seen to greatly reduce suicidal ideation. I feel as those us on this subreddit will be able to give a good insight into this necessary research, please if you can, take part.

I would love for anyone to take part, and hopefully you will all feel a benefit from getting in touch with areas of your mental health. If not, there are many help links on the information sheet for many areas of the world, so please feel free to use them.

Here is the link -- [https://chester.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/sleep-disturbances-study-part-1](https://chester.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/sleep-disturbances-study-part-1)

Sorry for the long rant. I've been keeping this in for a while. So I've been realising I've been battling depression and anxiety for a while, I've just always been denying it or trying to just tough it out. It's been like this for a few years now. I just keep telling myself I'm not that depressed, I'm just being too sensitive. Or that I've got no reason to be depressed anymore so I should shut the fuck up. But it's developed into a tick I can't seem to shake. It started getting really bad a couple of years ago. I got into a really bad car accident, and my grandma passed away a year later. I also failed my college program that I thought would be my saviour. Turned out I was not fit for it at all.  

I started a landscaping full time when things were getting really bad. I had started getting suicidal thoughts when I was on the job. Especially cause I was usually alone on a mower, stuck with my thoughts for 10 hours a day. Life felt so pointless. I'd end up muttering ""god, I want to die."" Under my breath a few times a day. 

Well that has almost turned into an inescapable mantra. It comes like a twitch, and is like a mini panic attack. It happened again this morning after calling in sick to work. I've had a bad flu for a week, and when they said I had to get a note, I panicked as soon as I hung up the phone. I felt like getting sick was my fault and they don't believe me and I'm going to get fired for wasting their time. I'm panicking about going back to the clinic because I don't even know if the walk in clinic does doctors notes. I haven't been to my family doctors in a decade. 

So I started pacing around with that twitch. ""Fuck I wanna die, fuck someone kill me, I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die."" Going on for about 15 minutes til I just cried for another 10. I find myself having slips like this at work too. And I'm worried about a co-worker or a loved one hearing it. Usually I just supress it really hard and try to focus on work or whatever I'm doing. But it's getting harder and harder.  


How do I talk to my fiance about this? I don't want to scare her or have her worry too much. Sadly I grew up in a house that wasn't very good at communicating emotions or talking about sensitive topics. So I'm not good at this at all. I've been avoiding this talk for too long though. I need help, I can't keep doing this to myself. I feel like I'm tearing my self apart. I don't want this to get any darker, I don't want my cat or my fiance to lose me to this.

I'm female, he's male. I'm getting treatment, he isn't. 

His current situation is that he's really depressed and talks about suicide a lot, about how he doesn't want to live because life is senseless.

We know each other through school, but since he's done with school and I'm currently not going to school at all we basically don't see each other.

Last year I tried to kill myself and he was actually the one calling an ambulance because he felt something was wrong. He saved my life that day.

Since then I've been getting better and he's been getting worse. (I had a huge relapse a few months ago and everything got a lot worse again, but I never hit rock-bottom again after the attempt)

I tend to hurt myself and often end up getting a load of stitches, he cuts himself too. But, thank god, his cuts are never more than scratches. It's still serious, but currently I'm just glad he can't cut himself deeper.

He rejects every professional help I suggest. He doesn't want to go to a therapist, he doesn't want to go to a mental health clinic. For quite some time he even refused to tell his mother, and even though I hated that, I respected his decision because I couldn't risk losing his trust. He would be completely alone if that ever happend.

So I did nothing but talk to him. I often felt like the biggest hypocrite, because I'm struggling myself and I'm telling him to do shit that I don't even do myself that could help.

Now, a few days ago he finally talked to his mother. He talked to me first and told me that his job is killing him and that he finally sees that he needs help. I was really proud of him for taking that step, but then his fucking mother literally didn't give a shit. She cut him off as soon as he began talking and told him that he just needs to get his shit together and that he 'can't pull that psycho number' on her. Then she just left.

Nothing happened after that. He was heartbroken, obviously. He refused to talk to her again, even after I suggested a different approach. He refused any possible help.

Now here we are. I know his mother and were they live, and I though about talking to her myself more than once. But again, I would break his trust if I do that. And it would be pretty bad for my own mental health, but frankly I don't give a shit about that if it would help him.

Right now he only ever talked about suicide. He never did anything serious to himself. Of course there is the selfharm, but it's luckily not that deep. Currently at least, who knows how bad I will get in the future.

I could go all out and ruin my relationship with him by going against his will and not only talking to his mother, but calling 911 when he talks about suicide the next time, but here's the thing: There isn't enough 'evidence' to diagnose him as suicidal, so he would just go home again. The only psych clinic in the area is complete shit and absolutely useless, so it wouldn't help at all. But I also can't wait until he actually does something serious.

And another thing that really doesn't help the situation is the fact that in a few weeks I'm getting admitted into a clinic on the other side of the country for at least three months. It's for my mental health, because after years of suffering and struggling I'm finally ready to get the help I need.

I really don't know what to do. Because if I listen to him and respect his wishes and he ends up killing himself, it's my fault. But if do something right now he probably won't get any help, unless his mother is willing to accept the fact that her son is struggling with depression.

And again, my own mental health is crap as well.

I'm a student studying abroad and broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago, and when I went home to visit family I saw her and the reality set in that we are actu
ally over, and she's over me.

It completely shook me, I don't know what I was expecting but it was very sobering. 

Since returning to my country abroad I have been extremely depressed. Without going in to details I am essentially isolated here and have been having to deal with the break up on my own, in my room. I'm really struggling with it and even at my darkest point considered self harm (I didn't do it but noticed how out of character it was for me to even consider it). 


So on to my question: what steps can I take to help my depression until I return to my home country and get professional help? 

I have been trying my absolute hardest to exercise, eat well, not lean on weed as a coping mechanism, leave the house even just for walks, playing an instrument. I am really trying so hard but the isolation makes it difficult and every morning I wake up feeling horrible and it is exhausting having to muster up the strength every day to do something as basic as make a coffee 5 steps away from my bed.


Also as a side question: I have been a daily weed smoker for about 2 years, including smoking in the day (although I am a pretty productive person while high), however since being here I have cut it way down to only a joint of an evening if I'm watching a film. I feel a slight guilt that the weed helps me cope with the situation because I know that at least for the time I'm stoned late at night I can take the weight off my shoulders even if its just for an hour or two. Is it really so bad that I smoke for this purpose?

Hey guys,

Title says it all. I am at the end of my rope. I have tried medication, excersise, counselling, change of diet, environment, job and sleep pattern and nothing seems to help and i am constantly feeling down and out and honestly have reached the point where i am constantly harming myself and genuinly dont want to live anymore. The problem is i know my life is going well. Apart from my depression, i have a job i love and family and friends who i care alot for and the same applys in return and i reckon that if i just find some form of help that works that i will be able to return to being a functional member of society and i am scared that in my current state i am going to make a massive mistake which i would regret and ruin any chances of that happening. 

Because of that i am heavily considering voluntarily admitting myself into a mental helath hospital untill atleast the time when my strong suicidal urge passes over. So i was wandering whether anyone here has done this before and if so what was the experience like. Did it help, do you regret going, if you were to give any advice to anyone going into one what would it be. I'm sorry if this post is all disjointed and over the place on the back end of mental breakdown and not thinking straight. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated and thank you in advance.

*note: despite what i said i am in no immediate danger of commiting suicide i have many events planned and i fully intend in going to them including my brothers wedding at the end of the year, however i do acknowledge that i am finding it harder and harder to manage those thoughts.

Then I got one and now my depression/anxiety has gotten even worse because of it...

I work 10-12 hr days with no overtime pay... never have time for lunch breaks...then I work at least another 8 hrs over the weekends to catch up...

I'm so tired... I wish I was dead. I don't want to sleep every night because I don't want to wake up. But I have to get up early either to finish more work or to get ready so I don't look as ugly and disgusting as I can be.

Everyone at work hates me. I wasn't trained properly so my anxiety is always through the roof as I do everything wrong.

I'm stuck and I can't quit because if I do the company will be in a bad place, and they have no idea I feel this way. Every time they bring me in I put on a smile and say I'm doing fine. I'm on the verge of having a breakdown, constantly trying to hide that my eyes are watering while I'm at my desk trying to figure shit out because I'm so bad at my job. I can't get another job because I barely got this one, and I can't leave this one without some kind of great excuse like getting a dream job or a job that pays more...I'll be blacklisted in this industry if I quit right now and I'll never be able to do it again. Not that I want to do any of it any more. But it's literally the only thing I've been to school for and know... I've known since last November that I'm not a good fit for the job and if I fail now I'm fucking them over so hard... It will put them back 3 months in their schedule. And I won't even be able to train a new replacement because I was never properly trained.

I wake up at 6, work, go to work, work through lunch, work until 9 pm, get in my car hoping I'll die on the way home, get home and work, go to sleep and dream about work. Wake up again disappointed that I'm still alive.

To top it all off, I'm not even making any money. I'm only breaking even on my rent, and wasting my savings on daily living costs.

Gaining so much weight because I can't take care of myself... I come home and binge eat while I literally talk to myself saying ""I hate you."" My neighbors probably think I'm crazy because I'm constantly crying or shouting I hate you and I wish you were dead to myself.

I don't even want a fucking career. I've always just wanted a family to take care of and to be a stay at home mom but I'm too disgusting to find a reliable husband and I'm too old now anyway. Idk what to do... If I have a breakdown my mom said I could come home and live with her, but then I'm a failure basement dweller, and she'll abuse me every day again. My dad is a narcissist and keeps telling me I have to keep going because he wants to be able to brag to his friends. My siblings are fucking around having a great time with their lives. No one takes me seriously any more when I tell them how sad and depressed I am and how I think I'm actually going to hurt myself this time. They just laugh and say I'm being dramatic. I've started scratching and digging into my arms and legs already but I'm just not sure how I'd kill myself yet. Just those passing thoughts about jumping off freeway overpasses, onto the train tracks, getting in car accidents.

I don't have time to find a new therapist because I can't take any time off work.

Then there was this vivid dream of me standing on the roof top of my apartment (I live on the 37th floor which is the highest of my building and we own the roof top) 

So I was sitting on the fence staring down. 

The height seemed scary at first, so scary that I might throw up but then one moment I decided to do it. To finally go end everything. 

I leaped and I starting falling. In my dream, I saw things in slow motion and it feels wonderful, liberating.

This isn’t a form of compartmentalization, this is me trying to separate myself from this condition and prove that it isn’t me. I am not my depression, I’m more than that and I’m doing the best I can to live that out. Further more, this is going to be a long post with many different directions, mostly just trying to straighten out my thoughts. I hope this is an appropriate sub.

By all accounts I have a pretty fantastic life. I have a family who loves me, a living and supporting partner, her family is loving and supportive of everything, I have a warm bed, a roof over my head, food on the table, everything I could want. I *shouldn’t* be depressed. I don’t want to be depressed (truth be told no one does). 

Yet I still am. 

The worst part is, I’ve had all the support I could want and more. Yet most things don’t work. I’ve been to therapy, I’ve tried medications, I’ve tried meditation, I’ve tried some self-help programs, I’ve tried some other things to cope that I’m not sure if the rules allow me to mention. I’ve tried so many things, and they just don’t work.

Honestly, up until about a week ago, I was honestly fine. For some reason I was fine for so many months.

This post is honestly going in circles because I have everything and nothing going through my head right now.

Both my family and my partner’s family went on a holiday a week ago (not together) for the exact same time frame. A bit of a coincidence to be honest. 

It’s hard being alone. I always felt alone when I was in the pit of it, but I don’t think I ever truly knew what being “alone” was. I still don’t think I do, but I’ve had a taste of it. 

To try and quell that I had some friends over recently. We had a LAN party and played Destiny 2. It was our first time doing something like that and we were all so hyped for it. We ordered pizza, had some beers, spent 5 and a half hours doing a raid while we were short a sixth player, finishing at about 4am. It was honestly the most fun I’ve had in a while.

Then they all left the next day and I was back to feeling alone.

I know I said that I’ve tried many things to try and feel better, with most not working, but something I do have is video games. Specifically Destiny 2. 

I’ve honestly fallen in love with this game. I even got my partner into it. For those who know the game, you’ll know how important a ghost is to their guardian. I called my partner my “little light” the other day and she loved it. For those who don’t know, a guardian is a someone who has been resurrected by a ghost, a little floating robot who is basically an emissary for the “Light”, a force of prosperity within the universe. They act as a source of the light for their guardian and offer up companionship and the light.

I hate this feeling of dependency on something to feel better, you know? Why do I need to play a game to feel better? Why do I need to have my partner with me to feel better? It makes me feel less than human, like I’m just a husk that’s missing something critical.

My mother labeled me as special needs as a child and didn’t allow me to learn to take care of myself. I learned from Sesame Street and classmates behind her back and then she tried to kill me. She encouraged me to commit suicide until I was 11 and she started discouraging it. Explicitly told me the only reason she doesn’t want me to kill myself is because she would be suspected. Age 15 I developed schizophrenia and she used that to control me too, explicitly encouraging it.

There was significant physical abuse up to age 11 when I was able to successfully fight back. Age 12 I developed anorexia and was weak, they beat me up regularly again. Age 14 I attempted suicide by cutting my wrist and was weak for 1-2 weeks, my mother rubbed hand sanitizer and salt into my wounds repeatedly and laughed. After that they didn’t hurt me directly but when I was 17 and having a psychotic episode my mother gave me a fork and shouted at me to gouge my eyes out. I got scared and threw it on the ground. She probably wanted me to become disabled so that I would have to depend on her. Age 18 she encouraged my brother to punch me in the stomach and hit my head because I attempted suicide.

She sexually assaulted me when I was 13 and allowed her friend and his wife to take turns assaulting me once when I was 5. I was digitally raped. She has mocked me over this repeatedly and interfered with the police report even though I did not even implicate her.

From age 11 to 18 I was in therapy where she would come in before and after to tell the therapist what to say. It was basically an hour of not talking about my actual problems and basically lecturing me about how easy I have it and telling me I can’t survive on my own. She also threatened to sue school counselors to stop them from getting involved.

Living here are also my sister and her s/o, who are 21.

I'm not sure what's happened within the past year or so, but this has become such a toxic living arrangement and it's sucked out every bit of motivation, energy, will to do anything, in me. Things weren't always this bad, but if I had to guess everything got worse once we found out we were having a baby and somehow still get worse as the days pass. 

My wife stays at home with our baby because it would literally cost more to pay a daycare to watch our child than she made at her old job. Until she finds a better paying job, which she hasn't been able to, we can't put her into daycare. I had a steady job, we had 10k+ in savings, every intention of moving on with our lives to get out of here but once she got pregnant, life got so difficult because of living here. 

For starters, there were nonstop fights about petty stuff, and then worse fights about more serious topics such as not wanting to be around cigarette smoke (dad is a smoker) marijuana (sister and boyfriend smoke it,smell like it, have gotten arrested for it, etc.), people being extremely loud and inconsiderate when they know the baby is sleeping, and no matter what we were always in the wrong for voicing our opinions and always heard excuses for it, and we would just get brushed off constantly, guilt trip after guilt trip, until we just gave up, sick of being ignored. It's put a huge strain on our relationships with each other and with them and things just keep getting worse. 

They keep enabling my sister's habits and ignoring them, letting her have whatever she wants so she doesn't get arrested again or have another manic episode where she threatens to run away or kill herself (has a past of doing this, though I believe she's on meds now and hasn't had this happen in a very long time. Couldn't tell you exactly because we're left in the dark even though we've raised concerns about it in the past). 

We've had 4 dogs, 3 of them mine and my wife's, which we take care of and had way before our baby, which were more than enough for the household, and now they've let her get a cat and another dog (the dog was after the baby, cat was a while before), which we definitely don't have room for, because they're afraid to say no. It's like my parents have just given up. Again, every time we've raised our concerns about this, it gets brushed off, excuse after excuse, and we're the ones in the wrong.

We buy groceries and cook dinner for the house, though we don't want to, because if we cook for ourselves we'd get bitched at, and we don't want to hear it anymore, but there's been plenty of times where they'd get the four of them food and don't ask us to join or if we want anything and we have to buy food from out to eat something or just not eat. 

Overall, I just don't feel at home here anymore and feel like an outsider in my own home with my own family, while all of them seem closer than ever. Any time we do get along it's very short lived or it's fake and we're just over it and want to move on. We've got the option to move in with my MIL, and she'd take us in no problem, but again, we've been holding ourselves back because we don't want to fight, to be guilted and to feel bad. It's getting to a point where I can't take it anymore and just want to leave but all of this is holding me back from doing so, but at the same time I feel not leaving is holding my life back. I've got no energy here, no motivation to do anything, nothing. I can't keep a job anymore because of how stressed, depressed, and anxious I am and I feel it's because of this living arrangement. I really don't know what to do anymore. 

Sorry for the long rant. Maybe this is the wrong subreddit to write all this, idk, but I had to get it out because I'm hoping someone somewhere can provide some input about what to do. If you've read it all, thank you.

our family of 10 almost everyone had a private room and other than that a big pool football field and the top floor was basically an apartment with a kitchen bathroom living room and everything and a pizza oven every Friday me and my brothers would carry him to the top floor and we would have a really nice time having dinner and play with my dog a siberian husky named raixe and making my dad happy seeing us all around him, bare with me I know this all sounds like a dream making it seem like I had the perfect life both parents are doctors rich and all that  but I honestly miss that place it's where I spent my childhood, moving on, years came and went I'm 14 my dog got hit by car and died and my dad's condition was getting worst by the week, And our income took a big hit since all my brothers and one of my sisters were in college (if your asking how shouldn't one have graduated by the time the others got into college well 2 of my brothers were studying medicine abroad in different countries,another two studying electrical engineering in turkey 1 studying for his architecture masters degree in jordan 3 where we lived but  in a different province 2 studying IT and my sister studying for her masters in mathematics) so me my twin sister and our parents I had a full on beard when I was 14 I was 6 feet tall ugly but strong, I just remembered a time I was carrying my dad up the stairs and I for some reason said ""dad God loves that's why he made me so buff at such a young age, it's so I can take care of you"" and he just cried and hugged me as tight as he can, oh and when I was nine he got heart disease and by the time I was 14 he has had two heart strokes, now that I'm thinking about it dang  my dad is God tier strong, anyway way I drove my dad to and from work almost everyday been doing so for a year and a half, it continued on like that for a while during that while the money was so tight that we sold our home for cheap and buy another one illegally (cuz middle east wars and shit) we weren't under the war thw country I lived in a kingdom won't say its name but fuck fuck fuck that country fuck it and everyone who runs it I hope that thay get raped then put in a fucking metal container with a window and set on fire so that have to look at there wife get raped while reaching for air while being cooked, the people in that country are nice and don't deserve te be under such bs rulers, I say this because the racist laws of that country killed my dad because we were piss shit poor and my dad had to keep his promises to his sons and daughters that that can study whatever they want wherever they want while not keeping shit for me and my sister because fuck us right we are just kids bitch I basically fucking parented all of my siblings' dad for two and a half years I had fucking school I had friends I gave that up to take him to the bathroom and even after he died I get fucking accused after trying to stopping my older brother from falcoon

brother and mom that I fucking killed him I wasn't even in the fucking hospital that night he was I was out fucking drinking and smoking at 14 with a bunch of gay people in country where being gay or drinking would get you deported but because I don't fucking have a  country and my passport is letterally worst than the the north Korean passport, I wasn't fucking depressed I was happy I didn't care that our fridge went from fucking full 366 day a year to fucking empty 366  in a year not because of me it's because him I wasn't abroad asking for a fucking titanic each time I pay for tuition no bitch I learned 4 languages while studying in my dad's car hot as shit  theres fucking stains of my stweat on the back and front seats of the car I fucking done nothingoh thay wonder why am I always looking for  a fight its because I didn't ask for nothing all I got from my dad is 1100 dollars so did all my brothers why am I getting accused of this bullshit I didn't ask to be born youngest to a family of 12 to a sick old father that none of his  children were there for him in his weakness I didn't get scammed for a fucking house and lost the only way for me to get a college education even if I would care enough to finish high school how would I get an education what go to my fucking piece of shit homeland and get airstriked for a welcome and live in the street by the time my dad died thay all finished thare education except him because he lied about passing classes and I'm the one being treated like a fucking criminal I never hurt any of my siblings I would never but after my dad died

once considered dealing drugs to get him heart surgery I considered selling my body  so some gay prince

I’ve been depressed for a long while. I can’t even remember the last time I was truly happy (save the bit I’m about to tell you). I finally found a girl that made me “happy”. We were together for some time when I eventually proposed to her. She of course said yes! About 3 weeks later we found out she was pregnant! She was so scared and I was too but I tried to make sure she didn’t know. After a couple weeks the excitement kicked in. Unfortunately the excitement came to an early end and we lost our bundle of joy on New Year’s Day 2018-2019. This really messed me up. Days started merging together. Weeks felt like months. She was planning our wedding and I just wasn’t there. I couldn’t get myself out of this hole. I couldn’t give her the love and affection she rightfully deserved. With knowledge that I know now, she felt trapped in our relationship and decided to go through with the wedding anyways, hoping that things would get better. We got married about one month ago, and I felt indifferent. The honeymoon phase just wasn’t there. She had been telling me for months that I need to go to the doctor and get myself figured out. Truthfully I was afraid to go. I was afraid of what I would be told, or maybe it was my pride. One night she just decided she was done being sad. She informed that she hasn’t been in love with me this entire time. To me that was a kick in the nuts and I got my ass up and made an appointment. I have a psychiatric and counseling scheduled this week. Nervous but excited. I love her more than anything in this world, but she has made it very apparent that she wants different things in this world and that she doesn’t love me. Any ideas on what to do to win or back? Or should I let her go and focus on myself. 

I’ve left out some details, if you have questions ask. I’ll be happy to answer.

I haven't been medically diagnosed with depression or any mental illness, and I am NOT self diagnosing. I just don't know where else to post this.

 As the title implies, I'm wondering whether I should text a helpline. Calling is out of the question, I have panic attacks every time I try to order pizza, haha. I know things like 741741 exist, but I'm not sure if I'm *worthy* enough for it. I'll give some background about my life and what I've been feeling. (This is mostly a vent post, just putting that out there.)

I've been feeling really bad for maybe four-five years now, but it feels like consistently, nearly every day, it gets worse. As of now, I feel as though just existing is hurting the people I love. It's much, much worse on the months that I'm at school. In summer and winter break, after about 2 and a half weeks I felt fine and happy. When I'm at school, I sometimes try to talk to people. I just KNOW that they hate talking to me and I'm nothing more than a nuisance. Before class, my friend group always meets up in the same spot to talk and catch up for a little bit, and my friends always happily greet and hug everyone except me. They don't talk to me at all. I'm just sitting or standing, wondering why they even tolerate me. I don't think they even look at me or think about me other than the fact that they're glad to have an excuse to get away from me. I just want to know WHAT am I doing wrong? WHY am I so awful? I feel so helpless then, because it'd be rude to ignore them but just me being myself is terrible too. That's one of the worst parts of my day. 

As an addition to this, when I'm hanging out with two or more of my friends, I tend to isolate myself and end up barely talking to them at all. Sometimes on purpose, sometimes it just happens. No matter who I'm with, they'd rather talk to literally anyone else than me. I don't blame them. I wouldn't want to talk to me either. I just want them to be happy.

And the last thing is less related to my friends. For example, at school, I can't do ANYTHING. I want to! I really, really want to! And yet, I can't. I try to pay attention to the lectures, but it just doesn't click for me and I end up distracted and totally lost. I see everyone else being able to understand it just fine, and I wonder why can't I do that? I try to do the homework or a simple problem? I can't make heads or tails of anything! It's like my mind is really foggy, and no matter how hard I try, I'm doing something wrong. I'm always wrong. I'm contemplating whether I should try at all, since no matter what I do I'm a disappointment. If my mom asks me to do clean the house, it just...doesn't happen. I can't bring myself to. One time, she got really angry at me and called me a disappointment and a little brat for not being able to do a basic task. And I'm not mad at her, but it's like every one of my negative thoughts were instantly confirmed. I tried telling her about my feelings many months ago, and though she really tried her best to make me feel better, it just made me feel worse. She told me that I'll ""stop feeling like this"" and ""it'll get better"". But didn't follow up. She never changed her behavior or offered to do anything or ask me how I was ever. It's like I never said anything at all. I am NOT mad at my mom. I LOVE her! She's super nice and tells me how much she loves me every day. But she's always been doing that and while I can believe her, I know she just wishes that she has a normal kid who doesn't cry when being asked to clean their room. I know I'm just a burden to her.

&amp;#x200B;

See? None of that is bad. All of the above is just normal, but my feelings about it are so, so awful.

I can't listen to my favorite music anymore because it's too happy and it makes me feel worse.

I can't listen to sad music anymore because I can relate to it too much and it makes me feel worse.

I can't hang out with my friends.

I can't do 90% of my hobbies.

I'm hardly ever happy when I'm not on my computer or phone.

I have cut myself a couple of times, but not deep and it hasn't been going on for very long.

I fantasize about suicide sometimes, but I know I could never actually do it.

I'm often wondering HOW I could possibly survive this all my life and dreading just being alive.

I have many panic attacks and cry almost daily, though no one ever sees/knows about these.

I often feel as though no matter what I'll do, I will never contribute anything to the world.

I isolate myself. A lot.

&amp;#x200B;

But I do have one savior. My phone and computer, as silly as it sounds. It makes me feel fine and even happy, when I watch funny videos or draw. I can forget how worthless I am and dominate everyone at a video game. I do digital art, and it's the only productive thing that actually WORKS! It's a great outlet! And it makes me feel normal! Like how I used to feel! Every like on social media is someone who I've made smile with my work, and it's exhilarating knowing that I'm NOT being total garbage for once! I just want to make others happy, and I feel like I'm doing well online! 

But I can't tell my mom that, who says that ""the youth is glued to their phones"" and locks it in a safe. So around 2-ish hours of feeling normal actual emotion besides inadequacy per day. 

I'm only 13, so I know it's probably just intense hormones, but why can't I ever be intensely happy, angry, or even scared for once? Why do I have to be stuck with the worst emotion all the time haha? And if others feel like this like they say they do, if this really is a normal way to feel, then why do I in particular have such a hard time coping? I feel like a helpline would make me feel better and be able to think more clearly. Thinking more clearly, I could focus on actually improving myself and being able to clean the house without bursting into tears. 

On the other hand, I'm just an emotional teen. My household, though a little strict, isn't toxic and is definitely not abusive. I have friends and a generally good life. I probably will get better once I graduate and live on my own, though I just wish I could feel better *faster*. Would texting a helpline really make me feel any better? Or more importantly, would I take up someone's time that could be used for helping someone who deserves it more than I do?

Recently I've just been so overwhelmed with everything from my appearance to my performance in school and its all been getting to be too much. My main issue is my appearance. I get told everyday constantly that I'm attractive and I have nothing to complain about and I simply just don't see it as that. I look into the mirror and often times, I'm truly disgusted with what is looking back at me. Ive struggled with my weight for my whole life but about a year back  I lost a large amount of weight in a dangerously short amount of time with all the wrong practices. I starved myself to the point I was fainting almost daily. I even resorted to binge eating and forcing myself to vomit it all out before I went to bed. I would spend hours working out to a point of exhaustion where I couldn't lift my legs to walk. I would go home and see the weight on the scale go down, and no matter if it was a single pound or five pounds lost. I always felt like I needed to lose more weight. I don't mean to sound like im wallowing in my own self pity, but this is just honestly how it was and this is my first time ever telling anyone about it.

All throughout my childhood I was bullied. Now obviously this is no rare occurrence, but it molded me into a very insecure person who deflects all my feelings with lame ass satire comedy. All I can remember being young, is going to sleep and begging to god every night in hopes that I could be ""normal"" like all the other kids. And as I got older and entered high school I would routinely go to sleep crying restlessly, wanting to be able to have something other than my weight on my mind.

As of 2019 the habits faded and I fell back into my old ways of binge eating. The feeling of the scale saying more than what I wanted it to gave me a sense of hopelessness that Id never felt before. Its absolutely crushing to go on a binge and stand on that scale afterwards. After gaining a few pounds (Nothing any regular person would notice, let alone care about) I went right back to that extremely unhealthy starvation tactic, and I genuinely cannot find the motivation to live happily without the starvation. My friends and family dismiss the issue as insecurity and the idea of a therapist is out the window due to my families current financial situation.

After a binge, I experience feelings of despair where I can't undo what I've done and I feel as if I deserve repercussions for binging if that makes any sense. As a male the subject of self harm can come off as a sign of weakness or lack of confidence. I used to cut myself routinely in the secrecy of my bathroom. I would just sit there crying and mutilating myself until I felt as if id done enough. Recently the urges to cut have been becoming increasingly hard to resist.

I can't seem to dig myself out of this whole that I dug myself into. I can't find the motivation to continue on honestly. The whole cycle is just far too exhausting to deal with on top of performing well in school and keeping my social life in check. I just want to be able to be happy with myself.

I just don't feel deserving of it. 

In and out of therapy, on and off of medications for years. Does it ever end? Is this just what the rest of my life is going to be? Mitigating my own consciousness against myself? I've got good days and bad days, but it all just seems like a wash in the end. It's not like they negate each other. There just seems to always be a baseline of stress and anxiety. I don't even know if I wanna cry anymore because it just sends me down a spiral.

I don't know if what I feel is depression, either. I just need a place to pour out my emotions.

I'm a male junior in high school. My father is American and my mother is Chinese. My life has been a mess of moves across China and the United States (due to various reasons). I've been to many, many schools; I've met so many people and seen so many things. But when I think of all the people I know and all the places I've been, I just feel empty. Purposeless. Insignificant. Because of the frequency of my moves, I have always struggled to get close to people. Whenever I think of all the people I know, I'm reminded of how lonely I am. How I literally have 0 real friends. No friends at my current location, no friends in my previous schools, no relatives I confide in, no one. The more I think about how much I've seen, the more lonely I feel. All the people and places feel began to feel like a blur during my sophomore year of high school. And slowly, I, myself, as a person, have started to feel like a blur. An unimportant, unintelligible blur. I don't know exactly how to describe it. Just all my emotions and experiences feel unimportant. The days pass by I struggle to find the motivation to do anything. I'm just passive. Nothing excites me. I can't remember the last time I really laughed and felt free. This feeling of heaviness just looms over my entire life. Everything feels so pointless under this feeling, this heaviness. Occasionally, I feel fleeting flashes of happiness. But fleeting flashes are all they are. Perhaps the reason for my sadness is a lack of accomplishment and growth throughout all the experiences I have had. Sometimes I feel like everything has changed around me and I've just been watching, never truly involved. Sometimes I want to be involved. I want to talk to people, I want to do things. But something stops me, and I no longer wish to be involved. I often think of all the opportunities I have missed. And then I get lost in a fantastical world of daydreaming, imagining myself in highly romanticized versions of my life in which I mean something. I have no passions anymore. I do not really play video games. I no longer play an instrument. I no longer play a sport. My grades are good. It makes my parents happy. It's what they tell me to focus on since I'm sad. People at school just see me as quiet, and a little downcast. I haven't opened up to anyone. No one thinks I have any real problems. I smile at school and I occasionally talk to people.

I want to be there for others, but my friends are just ones that pity me and try to keep things going, they all pity me and still try even though I haven't replied to them in days.
It's just a message a day, or a week.

I am just too lonely, and I can't or don't know how to maintain a conversation 
There's others that deserves help, but whenever I try to, I become even worse as I feel bad about it.

I am starting to think that it's impossible to get proper friends, like I had never had one.
My depression causes me to become desperate and  months ago that I would lie to others and fake a persona. I still try to help others while being a lie, I still care about others and I wanna make them feel loved, cared, special, and needed.

But I can't with my current self, I can't do it. I am losing myself.

I just want to get all of this off of my chest so sorry if it's all over the place and incoherent. 

my story isn't one that is traumatic or special in any way, it's just an empty void filled with the screaming voices of hatred and self-loathing. all my childhood I was the target kid for bullies, fat, nerdy and would get angry at the slightest insult or tease. my teenage years were filled with regret of the chances I didn't take and the stupid chances I did. now I am 20, and I know the whole ""I have my whole life ahead of me I shouldn't feel this way because people have it worse and blah blah blah."" but I just can't deal with it anymore

my family is one of pure loudness and hostility, at least that's how I see them most of the time. my mother will completely shut me out of her life for days if I make her the slightest bit mad. my father hardy speaks with me outside of a few times a week. but the worst one is my sister, she is the favourite, she is the one that has her shit mostly together while I' just here crying into my computer screen. she's in university, has a lot of friends and is doing so much better than me. but if I do something even the slightest bit annoying to her or say something that could be seen as rude to someone on the other side of the universe, she will flip a switch in her head and then become this demonic harpy out for blood. 

I’m alone, isolated, the social anxiety combined with autism that I have been stuck with all my life eats away at my sanity like a cancer. I stay in my room all day and play video games because the worlds that are there make me feel like I actually mean something in life. talking o new people is the hardest thing in the world to me and I just feel like the rest of my life (however long or short it will end up being) will be spent alone with nobody else but my family who loves the fucking dogs more than me most of the time. 

the few times I have felt close to happiness, life goes out of its way to change it. I found love once, turns out she was a manipulative bitch who used me to feel happy while I was left in the dirt, and cheated on me for the week we were actually together. I found a job once; the social anxiety became too much and I had to quit out of fear. I have made some friends; I hardly ever see them and they're more friends of my dad then they are mine. every single thing that could bring some form of joy to me has some giant downside that outweighs the positives. I keep getting told to look at the positives, but when there's one positive versus around a million negatives it gets too hard to focus on the good things in life. 

I have looked for help before, I have tried so many medications, and I have tried so many other things that could help but it all feels useless. I feel like I am destined to fail, like my life has nowhere else to go but down until I snap and kill myself. there is no change, every year I look at myself and break down as no matter what has happened, I always end up right back where I started, being a fat nerd playing video games never leaving the house.",True,False,[],False,depression,t5_2qqqf,592161,public,confidence,self,"This is me, and I hate it.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eroyed/this_is_me_and_i_hate_it/,no_ads,0.0

I’m a guy, that’s what guys are supposed to do, right? Look tough and hate the world?

But it ultimately wasn’t me. Deep down i never was the hardass i made myself appear to be. I’ve always been soft spoken and sweet. I love to talk to people, but never have been able to. I don’t want people to fear me, I want people to like me. I’m not masculine in any sense of the word. I looked back and realized I can’t relate to a single man I’ve ever known. 

That was made evident after I had grown out my beard for months, kept my buzz cut and just fucking hating myself. I was crying at work, crying at home, wishing I was dead. My appearance didn’t reflect me, and in came the thoughts that I’ve had before about wishing I were born a girl, except this time I couldn’t make them stop. 

Saw a therapist who specialized in gender issues. Learned what transgendered was and that it was a real thing. For four months while I saw her, I kept my hair buzzed and had a beard, crying and talking about wanting to be a girl. Then we got on the topic of hair. It’s a big identifier in a woman (I’m not here to be politically correct, I know). She told me that maybe I should start letting my hair grow out. It blew my fucking mind that was a possibility. I’ve never gone longer than a month without cutting it. So I stop cutting it and start taking hormones thinking maybe I solved all my issues (hint: It didn’t). I still had a beard for the 1-2 mo I was taking hormones, and it was a confusing time to say the least. I still looked like a guy, and there was serious mental conflict in how I felt and perceived myself, so I quit the hormones. I stopped seeing her shortly after, but I continued to let my hair grow out because it single handily gave me some control over my life I’ve never had. 

The first half a year was brutal. It looked so bad because of thinning on the top and I had lost any hope that maybe it would look girly. Every waking moment I thought about offing myself, but there was a little part of me that wanted to give my hair a shot and to give it time. It began paying off after maybe 7mo in which it grew past my ears. Since then my outlook has changed pretty drastically, I kind of loved my hair. Then a year passed, and now it’s been 14-15mo and I love my hair, except when I don’t. And it’s causing me major issues, and making me fearful of losing it to the point I’m verging on mental breakdowns over it. 

The top is still thin, and there isn’t a lot up there. Enough to cover my scalp, but if it falls down from the way I have it combed over, I have decently large lines of bald. Or if I run my hand through or comb it and feel a hair pull out I go into panic mode, go inspect it and see how thin it is and want to die. 

It’s the one thing that has given me my life, but when it’s not perfect or how I envision it, it’s the end of the world.  I look at a woman’s full head of long hair and the thoughts of offing myself surge back. There’s nothing that can be done. Therapy isn’t going to make my hair come back, or stop it from ripping out during grooming. My life is now tied to my hair. My life is tied to the goal our idea of me being a girl. None of those are actually achievable. Biologically I’ll always be a guy. I’m going to be called sir. My hair will never grow back what has receded. I know my future is hopeless, and I’m ready to throw in the towel and stop wasting time. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know why I was born this way

 Okay, so basically, I haven't had an intimate relationship in 10 years. To start off with that seems like it's important (even though it's fairly insignificant).. However, over the past couple months I have noticed a decline in my enjoyment of hobbies (video games, sports, etc). I have also noticed that on days where I don't work, I go to slleep at like 11 or midnight, wake up at 8 am, then take a midday nap around 2 or 3 for a couple hours. I don't feel tired, I just kinda feel like ""eh, I should nap to pass time"".. Couple that with what's happened recently over the past couple nights, and I just feel so fucking alone and... I don't want to say empty, but it feels....like there's a void I can't fucking fill. I'd hate to think that it's depression again, but with my disability and hardly any socialization (I live in a small town, where the only activities are hunting, bar hopping, and work). Everyone seems to be on the go all the time, and I literally come home from work, take care of my animals, and sleep until the next day... I am fairly guarded around people, because I feel vulnerable and don't want them to leave (it's happened too many times in the past as well...). The friends that I do have at work are often busy, so hanging out never works either... I have also noticed that when watching movies lately (over the past few days, I've seen Brittany Runs a Marathon and The Big Sick), that I end up crying at emotionally charged points of said films. I don't know if it's because I'm projecting my feelings of loneliness and wanting to be held or told it's okay etc that I break down and cry, but I don't know what to think about this. I've understood how isolation like this is trouble, but I just can't seem to break out of this funk... I'm on the verge of tears typing this right now because I feel so vulnerable and scared..

I keep thinking about all the people I’ve met and wondering why they like me, or if they really did.   I’ve got this feeling that my therapist would call anxiety,  but I’m not sure.  I feel like I’ve wasted so much time and so many opportunities.  I’m failing high school,  I have some motivation, but I haven’t any work ethic.  I can never sit down and read or do work, not while sober.  I fear that I will never get it together.   I also wonder what the point is,  I don’t want a family,  a job, or anything to do with this world really.   I fear my life has molded me into a cold monster.   I don’t recognize myself, I wonder if I ever really have.  I am so lonely, yet I struggle maintaining any sort of relationship.  Commitment and laborious tasks are things that seem impossible to me, but are essential in surviving this life.   I think I’m unfit for this world.  I’d work hard at taking the alternative path, but I can’t even start anything.   I spend most of my time doing nothing and trying to feel like I have in the past.  I just want to feel good and be successful, but I need some sort of regulation.   This regulation doesn’t exist, but I’ve been trying to get it with nootropic supplements.

I am a sophomore at university right now, and I cannot explain what a lonely ride it has been... 
My schedule is so busy that by the time I have finished doing everything, I have no energy for homework and no energy for socializing.
I have isolated myself completely, and I have never been more sad. I cry all the time, sometimes I do not even know why I am crying. I am scared.
I almost set up an appointment with a counselor at my school’s wellness center, but I feel so ashamed. I do not even think I can talk about how I feel without beginning to sob. 
I miss my family so much. They came to visit me for the long weekend and for the first time in a long time I felt genuinely happy. 
I cannot help but think I am missing out on everyone’s life back home. I feel as though time is passing and I am stuck in the same place I started out in. Before I know it my whole family will be gone, and I will just be a hollow human with a million regrets... I am so sad.
I have filled out a transfer application to move back home for college about 100 times now.
It is one of those things that I constantly think about but would not stand the humiliation of leaving my college. My whole family would be so disappointed in me. I am just so fucking sad and scared that I am never going to grow up and deal with things.

They kept him overnight and were going to take him to a psych hospital. The doctor saw the text he sent me about wanting to kill him self and wanted to admit him. He got his phone back and was messaging while I was at work saying he was going to the hospital and a ton of horrible things about me ruining his life. I asked how he has his phone and if they were already transferring him to the hospital. He said no that he got his stuff back and was arguing with the staff about going. During that time he sent me a message saying when he finds a way out of the hospital he will kill himself. He talked his way out of it and was able to go home. 

I left work early because I was so upset about everything. When I found out he had gotten home I was so afraid he would kill him self since just a few hours before he said he would make sure he’d do it. So I call the cops again. 

I get more angry messages when the cops show up. When I get a call back from the cop they said they couldn’t do anything. This was the same officer as the night before. I told him that just a few hours ago he said he would find a way to get out of the hospital and then kill him self. The cop basically said they can’t just force him into the hospital every time he says that. I also mentioned how he told me when I asked if he was really going to do it, he said he was. The cop said his story was he did it for attention and was not going to actually go through with it. 
I don’t believe that at all and know that he was going to that night. The cop said I could go to probate court and get some court ordered document that would force him to be evaluated more in depth. He said with the text I have they would grant that. 

My boyfriend said he wanted to talk and when I said we could meet up and talk about it he got mad and said he didn’t want to. He said he wants to break up with me. February would’ve been two years of us being together and we were planning on getting a house and then getting married in a few months. 

We work together so I saw him today. I couldn’t stop crying the whole way there and back. I tried my hardest to not cry too much on the job but I did about every 15-20 minutes and would have to use the little energy I had to stop. I’m so mentally and emotionally exhausted. He is still so angry and refuses to talk to me in person about this.  I wish I wouldn’t have called the cops. If it was for attention we’d still be together and everything would be back to normal. If it wasn’t for attention and he actually went through with it then I would’ve just went right behind him and we both wouldn’t be in so much pain. 

I really hope I don’t wake up tomorrow.

I have this fantasy of being sick/injured in the hospital almost close to death but make a surprising recovery. 
The reasons why I have this fantasy?
1. It creates mortality motivation for me. motivation that could last for years as currently I really don’t have any motivation whatsoever to keep pushing on in life.
2. It gives me a break from everything. I guess when you’re on a hospital bed, you take a break from everything, nothing else matters but surviving. As you prepare to die you find peace within yourself.
3. You see who really cares about you. And at the very least being terminally sick/injured causes people to evaluate the importance of you in their lives. You’re important to a lot of people for a short period of time.

I’m sad. I’m angry. I feel alone. I feel hopeless. I feel tired. I thought today was going to be a good day, and then it wasn’t.

I’m afraid that people will always disappoint me and let me down. I’m afraid that nobody I meet and get close to will ever show up for me in ways that matter to me. I’m afraid nobody will ever understand me, if they even want to try at all.

I’m afraid my family will never feel like a family.

I’m afraid my friends won’t want me anymore once they realize I’m not a 24/7 sunshine-and-rainbows positivity robot therapist cheerleader.

I’m afraid I’ll never fall in love. I’m afraid the men I want will never want me. I’m afraid no one will stay if they discover the real me. I’m afraid I’ll never have secure, stable, fulfilling relationships of any kind. I’m afraid I’ll always think those are too good to be true and never let myself get close to anyone.

I have a hard time believing people will stay even when I’m not easy to deal with, even when I’m sad or mad, even when I’m not serving them in some way. I have a hard time believing I will not be discarded. I have a hard time believing I’m important and I matter in this world. I have a hard time believing people want to do nice things for me out of the generosity of their own heart and I feel like I don’t deserve it. Is it because I don’t see any intrinsic value in myself at all?

What I really want to do right now is to isolate myself. Nobody is coming to hold me or comfort me or say the right things so there is no use in wishing for it. I have felt alone all my life. Nobody’s coming. I know it. There is no point in keeping a door open. To keep it open is to hang on to some amount of hope that someone will arrive one day and things will get better, and I’m tired of holding out. Nobody’s coming.

Someday all this pain, hurt, anger, and sadness will be useful.

I’m all cried out now and I have no energy to do anything else so I will just shower and go to sleep.

Tomorrow I’ll wake up. I’ll do my skincare routine and stick to my diet, maybe even put on some makeup and go for a jog in the afternoon. But I don’t know how I’ll ever fix myself and escape this loneliness.

You see when I get into a dark phase of depression, I usually know what to do to make it better. It´s just that I don´t have the energy/willpower/strength to do it. 

I know that I should get up before noon on the weekend, shower and eat properly and get some chores done before I reward myself with some awesome food or leisure time. I know that! But it´s so much easier to just stay in bed and hide from the world in those sweet half lucid moments of a dream. 

I know that I should go to the gym or at least do something for myself, to have some kind of goal to work towards, to have something that I can be proud of. 

I know that I should cook a proper meal instead of just eating a bowl of fucking cereal for dinner. 

I know all of that!! And that makes it worse. Yes, there are things beyond my control that can make life harder than it needs to be, but mostly it´s just me. And that is the worst part. I don´t have anyone else to blame, just me. 

So this year I said to myself: Fuck it. 

I. Will. Not. Give. Up!

For once, I will just fucking do the right thing. Not all the time, not in an obsessive ""I have to be perfect"" way. But in a healthy ""I can be proud of last week"" way. 

I started to work out much more frequently and I am already seeing results. I started to eat better and generally take more care of myself. I started to clean my living space, bit by bit and it´s a huuuuge difference. 

And you know what? I am happier. I am not out of the woods just yet, there are things that I need to tackle, but I am on my way. And if I ever hear that little fucking voice in my head that tells me to just NOT do a thing? I tell it to go fuck itself and I do the thing. 

I am proud of what I am and who I am. I am proud of what I have done and I am looking forward to the fucking future. 

And so can you.

I almost overdosed not too long ago, I took 270 mg of codeine in less than 20 hours and I’m fairly small.

I had been depressed ever since I was 14, up until 25.  I was unable to enjoy basically anything, aside from a couple of clutch wins in videogames where I felt like I actually won because of skill, plus sometimes when an intercourse went particularly well and I felt like the partner was truly satisfied, or for brief moments when one of my partners smiled at me with a happy, sweet smile. 
But every happy moment faded immediately and I fell back into my darkness no matter what happened. I could never really relax or be entertained or feel relieved. 
I always felt exhausted, irritated, frustrated, miserable, tried to express as little emotion as possible.
Multiple relationships were ruined because the girls couldnt live with someone who is never happy, who they cant ever really please or cheer up. I wasnt ever really enthusiastic about anything, only faked it sometimes when someone put lots of effort into cheering me ip or getting me hyped.
2 years ago we broke up with my former girlfriend. We were best friends for 6 years before our relationship started, and we've had been together for 5 years. I couldnt handle the loss. The depression got a lot worse. I stayed friends with her, and she got together with one of my friends. It was hard to handle, to say the least.
I got together with another girl, who I tortured for more than a year with my misery and my inability to move on from the previous relationship.
We broke up as well, and then I hit rock bottom. I felt like I can never move on, and I can never be with anyone because I would just torture them with my immovable sadness and my unfading grief.
I decided to do all thats necessary to move on, except sacreficing my friendship with her or him.
I started working out, paying attention to what I ate, a friend introduced me to goa and psytrance in particular, and I discovered that under the right circumstances I can actually dance, which I never thought possible. 
I started playing music at home and on the street with a good friend, started attending boardgame events with nice people, did some free courses with some groups of students I found online, and grabbed every opportunity to socialize with nice people. Made sure to shower, brush my teeth, keep my room clean, be noce to the people around me, reconnect with family members.
These helped a little bit but I still was almost just as depressed and I still hadnt moved on 2 years after the breakup.
Seemed like I will just suffer amd endure silently until I die.
Then I met a girl.
I never thought this is possible, not for me.
She made me feel excited, afraid, enthusiastic, relaxed, even confident sometimes. After so long, after SO LONG.. I felt happiness.
It feels like a dream still. My reality was misery for so long I feel lost in happiness.
But it can happen. Even for me. There is a way back to the light from the deepest of caves. If after spending 11 years in complete hopelessness and a whimpering wretched bottomless pit of sadness I have found the sun, you can too.

November a ""smei-relationship"" ended and that was the only thing keeping me happy, not long after every day gets sadder and sadder and now is at the point where I can barely function socially cuz every moment  is just me think how lonely I am.

I can't keep more that one or two friends since I can't spread my attention to more than one person and the one person I can talk to is most likely sleeping, also they've heard so much of me being sad that they are starting to get sad too, so I don't want to drag them down all the time. 

Im trying to get a girl friend near me but it feels sooo impossible to me. Dating apps rarely have anyone I'm interested in (intimidating, very affectionate, some similar interests. All combined are pretty rare here) , all the people on them love dogs but I'm alergic and/or just don't put effort into their profiles.

I've tried to push my self to go outside and meet people but theres nothing I can't think to, also I always back down and give up and can't do anything about it. I'm stuck at a point where I can't get happy cuz of my sadness stopping me and then the sadness is stopping me from getting happy.

I also do things like go on Reddit or tictok and find people I like, fall in love with them, then realize I have 0% chance of even interacting with them and get more sad. Odd thing I've noticed , most of the people I like are bi.
I know it's not good but I can't help it, I'd rather keep feeling worse than stay at the same level of sadness.

Anyways I feel like I'm going to be alone forever, I know it's not true but can't help it.

I just want to be happy again with a girl friend who gives me the biggest hugs, that's all.i ask for.

Those who know me on the surface think that I am wonderful. Those who know the real me have left or I pushed them so far away because that is what I do best. I push people away because I do not like myself. I honestly don’t even think I ever liked myself. Yet change scares me, maybe all this time of waiting for people to leave is in reality me pushing people away because I only know how to fail. I only know hot to lie, be lazy and deflect. I have probably always been the issue and just opted to never honestly listen to people when they told me now I make them feel. I don’t listen at all really. If I did I would pick up on social ques faster. I wouldn’t make those close to me resent me. I would know who I am and be proud of them. 
I am the toxic person in all of my relationships because I fail to take accountability for those actions. 
I manipulate
I play the victim. 
I leave out or omit whit I did to build that person to how they feel about me.

Was this always me?
Did this person form over the years? 

How do I kill off this version of myself. I don’t like her.

Why is it so hard to change?
Why am I comfortable constantly going back to this version of me that nobody likes?

How do I stop being my own worst enemy?

Who is my authentic self?

Where did this person come from, was she always here and people just ignored her?

I have made the person who cared about me hate me, regret me, resent me. I have been too stupid to see this.

How do I kill off this version of me before there is nobody left?

This is not somebody I want my daughter to be. I don’t want my daughter to resent me the way I am sure so many people do. 

This version of me needs to die, she needs to die because she is a cancer and there is a little for that this cancerous version needs to never infect. 

Things I dislike about myself 
-I lie

-I am constantly going in reverse

Which is fine, I'm currently living abroad and it has been a hell of a time fighting the many-headed hydra of immigration, but there's the way she went about it that really just broke my heart. 

First of all, adult life isnt just going to work and paying the bills, that's *all* it is. Get up, go to work, come home, stare at the TV until you either get up and go to bed, or pass out in front of said TV. Rent is due on the 1st, pay day is every two weeks, and nothing really changes except the weather. And as an Arizona native, you could say that doesn't change either. But right off the bat, that is exactly what it means to be adult and grown. Maybe you can treat yourself to going out to eat every now and then, maybe see a movie if you can stay awake through it, but other than that, your ass is at home. 

At 30 I should be trying to have as little contact with people as possible. I'm too old to do any type of partying, bars/clubs or otherwise. Plus who am I gonna go with? Everyone my age is married, and nobody wants to invite a single person to a couples-only party, hell they don't want to be there anyway, their spouse made them go, and they'll fight about it all the way home. At some point you're just too old for the nightlife. Get used to going to bed at 9pm, maybe 10pm on the weekends. And no, nobody wants to hang out with you, certainly nobody whose age starts with a 2. That's what the wife and kids I should be actively seeking to have are for, or better yet, I should learn to be so at peace with myself that I am never, ever lonely (that part I do agree with, loving oneself so much that you can be comfortable only with your company).

At 30 I should be finding whatever job at whatever company I'm gonna stay at for the next ""until I can't physically work anymore"" years. I never went to college, for multiple reasons, so that basically means Retail or Customer Service. I'll be a supervisor or team leader one day if I ask nicely. Probably not, though. Just be glad I get paid for eight hours of work per day.

At 30, love is dead. Well, in general, love is dead, anything or one that says otherwise watches too much hollywood bullshit and needs to grow up. Find someone who you can *immediately* settle down, move in, and start a family with. You're old to be dating for years and years. It's like a meme I saw on IG a while back, ""dating in your 30s is like, we ain't got time for this shit. You can move in this weekend, you're my emergency contact, we opening our joint bank account next Tuesday, we getting married in three weeks"". The real goal is find someone who can drive you to your weekly doctor appointments when your body starts breaking down, and come visit you in the hospital/retirement home. There is no talk of ""my ideal partner"", you're 30, you dont have time to be wanting a woman with x or y, and you don't need all that much anyway. I need someone with a stable job and cooks and cleans every so often and can pay bills on time and if we decide to have kids, is at least good enough of a mother to not raise psychopaths. In fact, having kids gives us a convenient excuse to not be or do anything. We're parents now. That's all that matters. Don't worry about what she looks like, either, everybody's looks fade anyway so there's no way she won't look like shit, if not now then later.

To further expand on the spouse thing, the only reason you get one is so you have someone to talk to and do everything with, a Person, if you will. You too old to be hanging with your bois, and they all at home with their girlfriends and wives and children anyway. Your wife is now your Person. Anything you want to tell or do with or invite someone, there she is, the one and only friend you'll ever need. Mind you, not because she really is your Person, but more because we both signed this legal document stating you are my Person (and vice versa) so we're each other's Person by default, whether we want to be or not (like I said above, couples party, one spouse didn't want to go, other made them, because Person). So it's not really get married for love or for friendship, get married so you have someone to talk to, so you don't go insane from loneliness.

Speaking of which, at 30, anything you were gonna be, do, visit, learn, whatever, if you havent done it by now, you never will. And once you become a father, that's it, that's all anyone knows or cares about you. You a dad. The end. 

Love is dead. Hope is dead. Self-betterment is dead. Goals, dreams, aspirations, it's all dead. That's all shit for when you're in high school and you still think the world cares about you. Half this shit is only for white-people (I'm African-American) anyway, the stupid shit they believe in. ""Real"" black people ""know better"". They know that as long as the bills are paid, the fridge is full, the kids are healthy (notice I didn't say happy), and nobody died today, that is *literally all that matters*. Again, peace, and stability, routine, normality. Your ass is in your 30s now. That young, adventurous stuff isn't cute anymore, and now you're just old. Go sit down and find something to watch on TV so you can eat and go to bed, you have work in the morning. 

It was here when, as I said earlier, I realized what was really going on. My mother, at 59 years of age, having survived a narcissistic mother, an abusive husband, alcoholism, workaholism, homelessness, depression, been lied to and stolen from and fucked over I dont know how many times, and currently battling a disease even I barely know about (cervical torticolis, yall can Google it, I honestly dont know how to explain it), is just....defeated. She's even said before ""they broke me!"" Dont ask who ""they"" is. But there it is, she's broken, and tired, and quite content that she is on her way out. She honestly doesn't want to be here, just counting down the days until she has a stroke or an aneurysm or just doesn't wake up one morning. Any vestiges of ""get knocked down seven times, get back up eight"" seems to have been beaten out of her, and she wants me to learn how to play it safe and be invisible and don't want for too much before it happens to me, too. Which is just tragic, because that same ability, to survive and succeed in the face of unspeakable odds, to be resilient, to keep going even all seems hopeless, I learned it all from her. Now she's over here telling me the complete opposite. 

Seriously though. If I were to call her and say that you know what, she's right, I'm just gonna come back to the US, get a lil job and a lil studio apartment, and figure out which one of my exes wants a second chance so I can marry her ASAP (""we don't have to date as long if we already dated once before,"" he said, tapping his forehead with a nod and a smile) and get to work on our first child, she would honestly be proud and say I made the right choice. And that just makes me so sad. Like, look at what life has done to this strong, proud woman. 

As for me....man, there has to be something better than this. There just has to. My mother just laughs when I say that and tells me to see if I still believe that at 35, since I'm not grown enough to get it now, but there has to, man, there just....or else, why even bother? Why bother striving for anything if the best you can hope for is a 9-5 job, monthly expenses, and a partner you don't love, hell you don't even like, but you also don't like coming home to a cold bed so there they are? It definitely reignited my own depression, as even my own mother is telling me all this now, and tired as I am, I have to pick myself up and keep fighting, keep believing, and keep...I don't know man, keep not ending up a hollow shell like that.

Also formatting is shit cause I’m on mobile. 

I’m not really sure what I’m looking to get out of posting here but I feel like I need to get everything I’ve been feeling for what feels like an eternity off my chest. I don’t even remember how long I’ve had depression. I straight up just said to my doctor one day that I want to get on antidepressants and that’s the only discussion I’ve ever had about it. It’s hard to actually think back to a time and remember it happily. It’s like everything I see now and everything I remember is washed out. Nothing really has feeling or distinction but rather just a grunge to it. At the same time though I don’t really feel sad. I really tend to have no feeling other than exhaustion. Everything is exhausting. Keeping my eyes open is exhausting but at the same time sleeping is exhausting too. 

I never have energy and I’ve reached the point where everything seems to be slipping. I can’t think of anything specifically that should cause me to feel this way. I shouldn’t really have anything to complain about. Especially when reading other posts here. I have a girlfriend of 5 years that loves me and I have a friend that wants to do stuff with me. Yet I still actively try to make excuses to do things on my own. I’ll be going about my day pretty much just feeling dead but then for some reason I’m crying but I don’t know why and I still don’t feel sad it just happens. Like I’ll be driving on a nice day with the windows down and some great music going and nothing is really wrong but I’m basically just sobbing. 

I’ve felt suicidal in the past? Maybe? I’ve struggled with thoughts of wanting to die so I don’t have to worry about anything anymore but then it would be too tiring to actually follow through. More like just a wow that would be relaxing but that’s too much effort. Everything is too tiring. Recently (i say that but it’s been like 6 months) I started on Zoloft which helped for a while (I think?) but now it’s gotten to the point where even swallowing the pill is too much effort and as such I’ve currently missed my dose for about a week. They’re just sitting on my bedside table but I can’t manage it. Before that it’s been intermittent. I was on a good schedule with it but for some reason I just kinda stopped and I’m not sure why. 

I’ve debated on finding a therapist or psychiatrist but trying to explain everything in a coherent manner is beyond what I have energy for. I’m extra exhausted because my next semester in college starts tomorrow. It’s been all I can do to convince myself to actually do anything. Although this will be like my 4th year of community college since I’ve been doing part time unable to handle anything more. All the classes are online because I’ve reached the point I literally can’t make myself interact with people in person. 

It’s like I have ideas for how I want things to improve and late at night (like now) I get small breaks in the dirty lens of grunge that I always see through that are full of color and desire for improvement but then it starts to fade when I realize the monumental work involved to get there when I can’t even get myself to reliably take meds to help me. Wishful thinking. 

I haven’t actually talked to anyone about this. My girlfriend a little but she’s had her own health issues to deal with. I haven’t really seen the point in speaking with anyone about it because what can they do? I can pay them to listen and suggest positive techniques that I can already read about on my own. However I don’t even have the motivation to follow through with it. At this point I basically need someone to just physically take over my body for a while. Get me on a functional lifestyle and I’ll hibernate for a while in the warm recesses of my mind. 

I’m 22 and pretty much in the worst shape. I’m over 300 pounds and I have a back injury that extends down my right leg that stubbornly refuses to go away. I’ve been doing physical therapy for that for the last 4 months but I’ve stopped for the same reason I can’t even swallow a damn pill. I literally feel like I can’t. I look at people who are happy and in shape (not even like super healthy just not 300 pounds) and it’s like wow that’s awesome they can just go about their day and do what they want. It’s so confusing as to why it’s so easy for others to achieve this normalcy. Just able to sorta go out and feel happy and do normal activities and feel moderately normal. 

I’ve tried keeping a journal but all my entries are only about the most negative toxic emotions I have when I experience an unpleasant situation so I’ve kind of given that up in lieu of just trying to forget anything except what’s in the day to day. One thing I’ve noticed lately is I’ll be extra sensitive to certain things. Like I’ll hear a nice score in a movie or video game or there’s a nice or sad moment between characters and I’ll basically just get a lump in my throat and tear up. There’s really no reason for it. It just happens. Basically everything feels wrong and I feel like I’m rotting. It feels like there’s something wrong with my eyes because nothing I see looks colorful or makes me truly happy without a pressure on top of it. It’s like the information that’s supposed to be sent to my brain to make me feel something just isn’t there.

I’m going through high school atm and I’ve gotta say it’s absolutely hot garbage. I’m terrified. The reason being, this community is so heavily gang infested that I’m scared to even go to the bathroom mid-class so my phone doesn’t get jacked. Even similar, afterschool is more dangerous. I take 2 buses to go to school and 2 back. I’m constantly trying to look uninteresting or not vulnerable to teenage muggers who always look for victims. It’s so common. I already seen a kid get put in check for money and people around him just does not care because it’s so *normal* in this crappy community. I grew up here since I was little and as a result I got anxiety and traumas. I’m always scared or nervous if there are people walking behind me on lonely sidewalks or streets. God if I told you guys which State I live in you wouldn’t believe it at all.
Enough about my community 

My classes are boring as ever. My math class especially. My low self esteem has lead me wishing I was dumb at this subject. I’m a nerd, introvert and awfully awkward with women. I’ve done good on worksheets and such which resulted in the teacher to give me more fucking math to do even though I hate it. I’ve been given a huge ass packet just to “touch up on my Algebra 2” because I’ve been aceing every quiz. Then she goes on and pressures me and says I should take a couple of AP math classes which leads me to become more depressed because of the undeserving talent I seem to possess and how I don’t want any of it. I should be glad I know math but there’s just no joy in doing it. Honestly. No one congratulates me if I get a 100%, only jealous eyes. Who’s gonna benefit from me being good at this subject? The teacher? Sure. It’s their job to teach kids stuff. My parents? No, they want me to be a doctor. College? Sure. And? Who else? Me? That’s right. But I feel so selfish and I just hate my own guts for it. It’s my fucking esteem.

I’m fucking useless. I just play video games and listen to music everyday. I’m invisible to my parents. They don’t interact with me at all. Yeah they love me but I’m not sure if they *like* me. I almost *want* to do chores just so I can feel useful to them. I just sit around the house thinking of how useless and a waste of potential I am. I don’t want to put in work into almost anything because I can’t. I’m missing warmth. My last hope for an enjoyable life is my parent’s home country. Every summer we fly down there and have the fucking time of our lives. No wonder we’re so poor. The only reason we’re in America is to make money so my parents can fly home. I have no other relatives here at all. I have no reason to be born. The only thing I’m working into right know is studying their language and u bet my ass I’m mastering that shit even if I give up. All I’m looking forward to is to see the rest of my family members. On that day I will cry my hardest. And on those days following I can finally rest.

But for now, I will have to suffer to try not to risk my life before that day comes.

It all started the 24th of December and for some reason she didnt want me to go with her to spend Christmas with her family. So the 26th rolls around and I find out she goes to her Ex bfs house to see her dog. I tried calling her and texting but no answer then after that night she said she moved in with me too soon and that she needed to go back but wanted to stay with me. After this all happened she finally comes back on th 28th, I was so confused why she at her ex bfs house so long and why she talked to him about our relationship and her worries about money. And the fact she already made her decision without speaking to me about it. Then this is where it got all bad, I confronted her about a lie and she just ignored and got extremely mad at me for it and wanted me to leave her room. Later that night I find out that she cheated on me back in August with a guy. Before her and I met in person in October, her and I dated since June 29th btw. I also found messages on her phone between her and this other dude about hanging out and going to dinner and that was in late September, I remember that specific day because she wouldnt answer her phone at all from 5pm to 2am. I saw that she gave him her address and he picked her up. I'm so devastated about all the lies and the cheating. Anytime I went to her about thinking she wasnt being truthful she'd make me look like a piece of garbage. So I confronted her about the lies and cheating and she played the victim card for the most part. After we broke up and she went back, she told me she still loved me and missed me and that she wished I was there, I asked her if she wanted to get back together she said not right now, so the next day she starts talking to this other dude who's a youtuber btw and I say the next day the same thing and shes like idk what to say that I think you're moving too fast we're friends. I started to lose it after that, days go by then she started to not speak to me as much and she unfollowed me on social media and eventually blocked me on everything. I went off on her because of how emotional I've been and clinically depressed, I wanted to expose her so I went to Twitter and called her a cheater and a liar and it was Huge mistake on my part but at the time I didnt care I wasnt thinking and I wanted revenge. After I deleted those tweets a couple minutes after. I apologized to her and I've made multiple accounts to contact her and tell her how miserable ive been and how bad I felt for that. She hates me.

To shorten as much as possible. In 2018 I was in a LDR (yeah I'm aware, not the most secure of ideas) but it was going strong, regular video calls, sending packages back and forth and a plan to meet up. She seemed much more my type than woman I've been involved with locally. At the turn of the year though she did a complete 180 in character, became barely responsive and eventually just vanished. Obviously my mental health didn't do so good with this for months but slowly I was starting to fill the void, however around May 2019 she reappeared and apologised profusely, constantly, saying she was in a dark place etc etc. Naturally me being me knowing what can be like accepted this but remained cautious at first not pressing about anything about a relationship, just continued to talk. When I felt comfortable enough things with us seemed to just flow back to normal like the previous year and it was all go again. At one point she started to seem off again and later admitted that the real reason for her previous disappearance was that her ex had begged her back, but it was an extremely toxic, emotionally abusive and controlling situation so she got out again and again apologised profusely and said she wanted to better herself and move on. In hindsight, continuing from here was a massive mistake, but I've always believed to at least give one chance, anymore and that's it.  She later sent a package for my birthday which included some nice handdrawn, painted cards which all had entries that obviously a long time and effort was spent on. One of them was more apologies and that this time she wasn't messing around and that I'm the type of person to help her improve etc etc (all BS now but at the time it seemed from the heart)

Fast forward to December and the start of this year, she starts acting like prior to her disappearing act again, cancelling video calls etc. I already know something is up but I don't say anything at first until it came to long periods of ignoring. Eventually after a lot of beating around the bush she admitted that its basically the same situation again, the ex wormed back in the background and she went for it. This time I made it clear that's basically it, however I was extremely mature about it and her reaction was like a disbelief that I wasn't going nuts (like if I did it would make it easier for her to justify it all). 

Anyhow just before this I was waiting for my Xmas parcel I sent to arrive on her side (and this is the part that makes me really angry). I kept in contact talking civilly about what's happening with that, I paid for it so I just want to know if its arrived, if not I'll use my receipt and claim the value back. She was decent about it too checking on her side, no other convo apart from that and some small talk, whatever I'm just being tidy about things. Then one day I wake up to a torrent of abuse from her ""Fuck you's"" ""Son of a bitch"" just spammed on my messenger, I also had a message from her now not so Ex who I've never seen in my life telling me to leave her alone, she's not interested and my parcel will be dumped. I couldn't get any sense out of her following that, anything I said was just met with more non sensical abuse. I'm the only actually wronged party here and suddenly I'm getting double teamed? What? And what gives some random dude the right to what happens to my parcel. The last thing I left was telling her to at least give the contents to some children on the street or something rather than bin it all, at least it'll be appreciated there.

I'm just so low and angry that no matter my approach, someone forces the ending into toxicity beyond my control, I don't even know this guy and suddenly I see he has complete control that the girl who you know wouldnt have any confrontation and never anywhere close to that attitude is spitting a torrent of non sensical shit at me like a robot like all previous interactions are just deleted. My parcel gets dumped because of some guy I don't even know calling the shots all of a sudden. And there's nothing I can do about it, there's no sort of justice, they get away with it, the abuser wins.

It's just such a massive time waste, I don't have to energy to start the whole process again, I'm already not compatible with a lot of people or people don't wan't to get to know me. It feels like any action has to have a particular ending no matter how nonsense it ends up looking, like it was done by a terrible writer. The hostility at the end there just didn't make sense. I just don't have any energy or faith left in people, it's always a backstab like this. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who takes all my interactions and experience with a person into account while everyone else just resets on a daily basis.

If I should post this in another sub please let me know and I'll do that. Using a throwaway because I've never posted advice on something like this before.   
I've suffered from depression for as long as I can remember (I'm 29 F). Right now I'm diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but as I'm sure you're all aware this stuff exists on a spectrum. For a long time I only identified with having depression, as I tend to cope pretty well with nerves and social pressures etc.   
Up until about three years ago I managed fairly well with my depression. I completed a four year bachelor's in four years, and loved every minute of it. I've worked in local libraries my whole adult life (until three years ago) and was pretty happy. It was only shitty in the same way every job can be shitty at times.   
So, three years ago I believe is the catalyst for my current situation, which I'll get to shortly. I had a car accident where another driver drove on the wrong side of the highway. I couldn't avoid it as there was no shoulder on the road and the other lane had a roadtrain in it that couldn't go anywhere except straight either. So I collided with the other car at 80km/hour. Ultimately all involved were ok with only minor injuries from airbags/seatbelt etc - all the things that save your life (buckle up!). But I remember thinking ""oh shit my parents are going to get the call that I've died, and it turns out I don't want to die!""  
Of course depression is great at coming back so my inner conflict of being grateful to have survived and disappointed that I didn't die has been ongoing since then. I resigned from my library job to heal and I just felt I'd wasted enough time in a job I didn't really envision myself doing long term.   
So for the past few years I've tried to find other work, and have been very successful at that. But I cannot keep a job. I can't shake the bad feelings ever, it seems. I used to just get up and go to work or study. The anxiety has increased hugely and makes it difficult for me to go to work and cope with the chaos in my head.   
I met the love of my life in June last year. We moved in together in October, and things have been going fairly smoothly. The past week however, i have had severe breakdowns where I don't even recognise myself. It's like an out of body experience. I start to feel catatonic and then teary and then just like I'm going to explode because the feelings are so bad. I want to die in those moments more than anything. There are things that my boyfriend does to annoy me or whatever, but he is a seriously caring and supportive man and I want to make clear that I'm not faulting/blaming him whatsoever and he doesn't deserve the things I have said/done to him when in that state.   
I got so bad on sat night that I couldn't sleep. Thought I'd go for a drive and calm down but it just ended up with me getting hysterical, him driving round at 4am (after waking to find me not in bed) trying to find me. He called my parents and they came over and took me to hospital. I was just hysterical, totally of unsound mind. I had yelled at him to let me go, stormed away from him, told him I wanted to die, and he just reached his limit (again, this hurts me but i 100% understand that people have limits and they need to look after themselves and their own mental health, and also just point blank do not have to tolerate anything at all).   
He asked my parents if I could stay with them. He chose to not speak to me while I was in hospital and I know he's spoken a lot with both my mum and dad (who are wonderfully supportive and it's not lost on me how lucky I am). My dad told me (secretly) that my bf had called him crying saying he'd been planning to propose to me sometime this year, so now I feel even worse about this situation.  
We've been speaking a little bit, I'm trying to articulate to him my remorse but I know sorry doesn't help. There's nothing I want more than to get better (or improve at the very least. Work and learn and enjoy most of life). I feel abandoned by him when I need him most but realise he knows I'm in safe hands and is keeping tabs on me.   
How can I begin to show him I am serious about using this entire week as a new catalyst for my life? I don't want him to think I can just snap out of it and have zero bad days, but I do not want to ever put him through any sort of trauma like this again. That goes for everyone in my life, but particularly him at the moment, having borne the brunt of my breakdown.   
Sorry for the wall of text.

She always listened to me and she helped me so much, saying always the right words to make me feel better and helped me develope my personality a bit more as she also told me if I am doing something, she doesn't think is right and over all, she was the kind of friend, you read about in books or see in movies. Even though, she was always quite smiley and very shy, you knew she was kind of a serious person and sometimes she looked like if anyone get's close to her, she's gonna throw a punch and other times she looked like she wants to be somewhere else and so deep in thoughts with a look on her face that we made the joke that she is thinking about her time in war. Of course she never did and after some time, we accepted it as a personality trait of her. All those times, I felt like no one of our friend group was really able to get close to her, like really close. We only knew little about her private life and she never talked about herself. So, right now I am really scared as I never really questioned much that she always wears long sleeve but one time, her sleeve pulled up a bit as she stretched her arm out and I could see a bigger vertical scar on her wrist. I said nothing as I couldn't really understand it but I know it is wrong but I was worries, so I went through her bag, while she was in the bathroom and she likes to write and draw in class but she never showed us what she was writing or drawing and when I opened one of her books and after some empty pages, I found little sentences everywhere (I think they are verses from songs maybe? Because she has those key notes and the end and the beginning) and it scared me a lot, as there were things written like, feeling numb and just wanting it all to end and being in a hole with no escape.

I think the main thing holding me back is a couple of things.

1. I believe I have autism/aspergers but never had it diagnosed since I was a child. My parents didn't believe such a thing existed and this was in the 80s/90s when it wasn't well known. I was always different from other kids unable to socialize. I don't mind socializing now and I think I'm a lot more emotionally stable and stronger than before. My greatest weakness in socializing is of course I can't really talk about myself as there isn't much to talk about which is of course sad as I'm in my 30s when people should have much to talk about.
2. I have this fear of applying online. I'd rather go to the workplace and ask for the job, get an interview or look for a job without a resume because face it I don't have enough work experience to really stand a chance with a resume. So I'm thinking if I can get a job that doesn't require a resume that would be great.

But what about the people who don't feel or think that way? What about those who are tired of waking up everyday to do the same thing all for the sake of doing it again the next day? What about those who have nothing to look forward to (dreams, objectives, etc.)? There is no easy way for them to ""quit the game"" or anything like that, and it's because this world isn't made for them.

Life exists because living things don't know any better, except that, in the case of humans, they are conscious of themselves, of their lives, and their deaths, but there's noone that will tell them that it's okay to want to die because most people who are alive are people who want to live, because that, unfortunately, is just logical.

If you help someone else die, you go to prison because, for some reason, it's a crime to euthanise someone who isn't terminally ill or something like that. But somehow it is not a crime to force someone else to live even when they don't want to? Fuck off.

And suicidal people are always told that ""things will get better"" or ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" well, my answer to that bullshit is ""what if things don't get better?"" or ""what if the problem is not temporary?"" or even ""what if life is the problem?"".

Most people can't understand how it feels to want to die, to find no purpose or point to these existence or even this world, and that is because most people want to live, that's just it, so we are a minority that doesn't get heard; we are instead told that we are sick or confused so ""things might be different in the future if you just stay"". Well ""hell yeah, i sure wanna spend the rest of my life working in something i don't want to prolong an existence i don't want in a world i don't want to be a part of, all of that so that maybe someday i'll magically want to live"". Seriously... stfu.

And, listen, i know some people may just be going through a very rough time, maybe it's even a very long time so that's why it seems like things won't change, but they do have a chance, probably; i mean, they may at least have some sort of dream or just something they want to accomplish, and that could be enough to stay... and to make that effort worthwhile. However, my message is not for them, i just wanted to say that i know some people do need help in the form of counseling or therapy or something.

I am here to tell the people thay truly see nothing for themselves in the future... that it's okay to feel this way, that if you believe your reasons to want to die are very justified and there's nothing that's gonna change them, then you should be able to end your existence. You didn't ask to be born, you can't be forced to stay. Perhaps someone will rise up and speak for us, so that the rest of the world stops discriminating us, maybe even attacking us just because we don't want what they want.

I (23 year old student) have been struggling with moderate - severe anxiety for the past 3 weeks (since new years day) every since I took 20mg of metoclopromide (Reglan) for nausea due to overeating. 20 minutes after ingesting metoclopromide, I had a panic attack and for the next 3 weeks, I experienced what I would describe as a constant state of tension/anxiety (no reason I could think of). I do have moments that I go back to feeling normal but that is rare for the past 3 weeks and usually short lived. The 3 weeks have been unbearable for me, and I even broke into tears (for no reason) on several occasions.

This is highly unusual for me because:

* My life is relatively stress free, and I am in my final semester of university, no grade problem and eager to start work (I have secured a full-time placement with my favourite company).
* I have no prior history of mental issues up to this point in my life.

I have seen a psychiatrist but she has been only eager to prescribe me Xanax and told me to ""relax"". I have taken Xanax (1mg XR/day for 1 week) but they only seem to work momentarily, I still get anxiety most of the day. I am also aware that Xanax is not a long term solution for me.

Have anybody gotten a similar experience to mine after exposure to Metoclopromide (Reglan)?

The following medical literature I have researched highlights two cases that are very similar to mine:

* Organic affective syndrome associated with metoclopramide: case report.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3957883](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3957883)

&amp;#x200B;

* Akathisia, panic, agoraphobia, and major depression following brief exposure to metoclopramide.

sometimes, when the sad is crushing, i watch pewdiepie and other yt videos to shut the voices out. reading novels also helps. then there's the big sad; the sad that makes me cry, but no tears so i just whine like a fool in my room with my unfinished paper as my audience. im afraid. it's this vicious cycle and one day, ill run out of ways to cope. maybe it's the school? the teachers?

I did graduate but only because they were tired of me. I managed to get a job at BK when I graduated. But because my sperm donor got sick I had to take care of him. No one else would.

I miss her touch, I miss her lips, I miss kissing her forehead as she forced herself to pee, I miss cooking with her, I miss cleaning up after cooking with her, I miss cuddling with her in bed, I miss showering with her, I miss joking around with her, I miss going to places with her, I miss holding hands while I drove, I miss falling asleep and waking up to her cute little bunny teeth sticking out, I miss trying random food with her, I miss watching movies and TV shows with her, I miss my poopy, I miss my love. Meant so much to me, what we had was special. 

I just wish I could turn back time to 2018 and restart all of this again. I want to right my wrongs.

Sorry to say, no one can understand what another person is experiencing. Whether the person is depressed, happy, psychotic, or perfectly sane, all of their feelings are their own. We can relate to one another on some levels, but we humans are alone in our little existence bubbles. So maybe looking for people who can relate is more productive than trying to find someone who understands. 

Does this make things worse? Maybe, but it's the same for all of us - even those who aren't cursed with brains that malfunctiion and try to hurt us. Some of us have some loving people in our lives, some don't. None of us is alone in our loneliness. Even people who love you can't understand no matter how they try and we will never understand them. 

Yes, it would be great if the people we love understood what we're going thru and it hurts like hell when you realize they don't. Hurts even more when they don't even try. Maybe they're shallow or maybe they realize that there is no way for them to understand and they don't put out the effort. Depressed people have so little energy as it is, we should learn to stop wasting it looking for things that will never be. Acceptance is our only chance to moving on. Accept that life sucks for us in ways others won't ever get and accept that we will never understand those people who think everyone can choose to ""be happy."" 

I like to think, ""Fuck those ""be happy"" people anyway."" Let them waste their efforts trying to convince others to be a way that they cannot. Learn not to waste your precious energy hoping others can understand something they never will.

Recently I've been feeling down again for a week or so and I couldn't resist venting again. I just realized that I'll most likely drown and die in loneliness. 

I'm 20 (21 in less than 2 months by now) and I almost never had any IRL friends. I was always bullied at school and kicked from class for as far as I can remember, barely anybody liked me and wanted to know me. I was put into a special school program at 6th grade because I was suspected to be on the spectrum and it only screwed up my social development. I almost never had any girlfriend either except when I first just got into college. My family was pretty much dysfunctioning and toxic too because I was a product of rape and I only live with my stepdad now.

I tried to get professional help for my depression/anxiety multiple times, but the mental health system is bad where I live in and the only therapists I've been to were toxic, and most good therapists cost a lot of money as well.

It was better close to my graduation, I met up some girls from other classes and everything was fine for a while for once, until I got into severe depression because of my grandmother's death 4 years ago and I destroyed all of my friendships with my shit personality and lack of proper social skills during that awful period. 

Now I am friends with one of them again since around 1,5 years ago but I don't talk with her that much anymore and I usually don't know what to talk about with her either, although she understands my social struggles and anxiety, tries to carry the conversation at times too. I'm stuck at this for a while.

It wasn't too different at college, I somehow managed to friend a group of girls on my first or second day of college, it lasted quite of a time but eventually it became toxic enough that I left the group myself and I almost had a date with one of them, which she just dumped me the day before it. Since then I was completely lonely again and dealt with bunch of bullies for years, surprises me how I graduated through so much pain. 

Now I totally don't see myself ever having any more opportunities to make any friends or a girlfriend if I don't get into a uni or something, I don't visit too many places often and rarely go outside and my only interests are video games, drawing and coding, most especially Life is Strange.

Other things that constantly bother me are my height and my looks, which is just 165-170cm (5'5 to 5'7, not sure exactly) and I look and sound like I'm 15-16, many girls tend to dismiss shorter guys because taller guys are seen as stronger and more manly, and it really puts me down that this is a thing, although my girl friends never thought of my height and even hung around with me before and they are around my height. 

This still bothers my future friendships and dates regardless if I'll get rejected based on my height/looks. I don't know what to expect and do anymore. I'm a lost hope for everything, just a plain waste of oxygen that wasted his talent.

This isn’t the actual definition of insanity. Someone who does this may be short sighted, but not necessarily insane. But I’m gonna use it for depression.

I have struggled with clinical major depression and panic disorder (an anxiety disorder that has no real triggers) since age 6.

I’ve tried everything. I’m 24 now. They actually COULD try ketamine or MDMA infusions, but those are insanely expensive and not covered by insurance. I could try ECT as well. What I mean is, I’ve eaten clean. I’ve exercised. In fact one of the most depressive episodes I’ve had involved me working out 5-6x a week. I’ve done the meds... dozens and dozens of them., some didn’t work, some stopped working and some worked. Therapy. Vacations.

Why am I so adamant you try everything before killing yourself?

Once you feel happy, normal again—you do everything in your power to keep that way, and when you relapse into a depression it’s not nearly as bad as it was before, because you acknowledge you can feel normal again.

I have a close friend who was considered treatment resistant. She’d been dxed bipolar, and hospitalized 6 times for suicide attempts/depression. A doctor finally put her on a low dose of adderall for “narcolepsy” (they did a sleep study and she doesn’t even have narcolepsy, but they tried adderall anyway). She’s off everything besides adderall. She recently relapsed into depression after almost 3 years, but guess what she told me? “It’s no big deal. Now that I’ve been happy and functional I know I can feel it again, and will be okay”.

I had a legitimate bipolar psychosis at age 21 that left me empty, suicidal and regretful. I was so scared I’d slip into that again. It was terrifying. I’d be driving home from work and forget where I was. I once drove to my then boyfriend’s apartment, and had a blackout where I forgot who he was and stared at the wall for an hour listless and catatonic. I hit someone’s car in the parking lot and didn’t realize it as I was hallucinating. I’d smell my mom smoking, as if she was right in my face, and she’d be nowhere to be found. People told me I had a 1000 yard stare. I never wanted to go through that again.

I went to outpatient/PHP for self harm. I had the ugly habit of picking open my skin from anxiety, causing bleeding and scarring.

I nearly attempted suicide, taking part of a bottle of Xanax until I broke down and cut myself up.

I’ve battled an ED which is coming to a head as I’ve gained on seroquel.

I was molested as a prepubescent child and raped twice as an adult, causing me to drop out of college.

Depression gets you listless, unmotivated and delusional. I call depression a delusional illness because you are DELUDED into thinking the world is better without you. Some people call that selfishness. I’ve experienced it, and it’s not selfish. It’s delusional. How can it be selfishness when you genuinely BELIEVE your kids, wife, husband, family, friends are actually better off without you there.

My point? Try everything. I know depression makes you not wanna try. But this is a fight for your life. It’s not anything to take lightly. It’s not “I took Zoloft a month and a half, guess I’ll just quit and die”. 

Once you do feel happy again, even for a few weeks, you’re going to be stabler in your depression because you know happiness is possible again.

So go outside. Try the meds. Go to therapy. FIGHT until you can’t fight any longer, then fight some more,

I fortunately found a med that doesn’t let me go psychotic and keeps me at a good baseline.

Not to advocate nor prescribe any specific treatment but my understanding of depression is based on the theory that depression comes from loss of hope of meeting unmet needs. The loss of hope of meeting a psychological need or desire that was so important to that individual that when faced with the repeated failure to meet that need they come to the conclusion that that need will never be fulfilled and loss of hope sets in. Depression is a signal in the mind that causes an individual to hyper focus on that unmet need and causes unrelenting pain to that individual until that need is fulfilled and suicide is the peak impulsive act of desperation in order to stop that unrelenting pain. People often times say that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Which I always felt was a horrible meaningless platitude based on the fact that nobody really knows if your temporary problem is actually going to be temporary. To the depressed individual to view your problem as temporary you would probably not even be depressed because you would still have sufficient hope that you could eventually attain that unmet need that was causing you so much suffering in the first place. Depression is the point at which that hope ceases to exist. This is of course speaking to depression that is not solely caused by a chemical imbalance or is strictly medical or medication induced depression. Most advice offered attempts to place a bandaid on the situation instead of providing a solution. Exercise, long walks, meditation are ways in which to mitigate the symptoms of depression they are not the solution to riding oneself of depression. Which is why constantly using measures to distract oneself, healthy eating, music, exercise, etc are not solutions. The only solution to ridding oneself of depression in my opinion is to regain hope. If one has regained significant hope that they can attain their unmet needs depression will be alleviated. Depression cannot coexist with hope. Depression is a very egocentric and self consuming thing. Focusing on what your grateful for instead of what you lack and advice like that are all focused distracting yourself away from the problem. A person must realize what unmet need that they have lost hope in attaining and take steps to restore hope in that they can achieve that unmet need. Depression is a signal in the brain that is telling that this need is so important to you psychologically that until you can convince your subconscious mind that it can be achieved and that their is hope your brain will cause you to suffer until actually address the problem. However, in this life we must also understand some of our unmet desires have to do with and rely on factors outside of our control or simply will take time and in the midst of that time you will suffer till you achieve that goal. So the painful emotions that occur during this time serve no purpose and are unproductive. If you desire love from another person to achieve that goal will involve suffering, rejection, failure, heartbreak, and time because it involves factors outside of your control with pain being a requirement in the process of finding love. I personally am an advocate of being numb over being in pain. When I google search ways to feel numb or how to feel numb I often see attempts by people who seek to romanticize that without feeling pain one would not appreciate the good points on life which I feel is feel good bullshit. Suffering is not productive. Being depressed all day in bed crying is not productive it wastes time. Other people suggest numbing agents that have bigger consequences alcohol or other addictive substances. There are many antidepressants of course but many come with alot of side effects many which ironically can increase suicidal ideation. I'm a proponent of nootropics of supplements. They are less addictive and sometimes come from more natural means. We have to realize that our emotions are in part related to neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. I personally do take wellbutrin as that is one of my prescriptions however in order to feel emotionally numb I take a series of supplements such as L-Dopa, L-tyrosine, L-thenanine, 5-HTP with vitamin B6, and GABA supplements. Often times I find most people have little to no information on mental supplements or simply are highly skeptical of their effectiveness. I personally I found that these supplements when taking together can help me achieve mental numbness in times of crisis. I also find that Excedrin especially the PM version which includes acetaminophen, aspirin, and benadryl have allowed to get through many a rough night when my desire to commit suicide at night had reached its peaked and allowed me to sleep to then wake up more rationally since the peak of suicidal ideation is the peak of unrelenting pain and impulsive like being on fire without any means to put yourself out. I personally have found that experimenting with these supplements with the inclusion of excedrin have helped tremendously in helping mitigate my depression symptoms and induce mental numbness. GABA supplements in particular I find are just as effective as taking a benzodiazepine without the additive qualities. Anyway those are my thoughts and a method I suggest to achieve emotional numbness in the face of unrelenting psychological pain. Of course one must do their own research on these substances before use. For me cognitive behavioral therapy or really cognitive psychology period does nothing for me and the process of trying to rewrite the wiring of my brain so that it is not constantly spewing negative thoughts has been a futile endeavor at least for me.

This isnt my first post like this but every time I think I get closer to explaining my dilemma. 

I've been through so many ups and downs the last 6 or 7 years dealing with depression. Or at least I thought they were ups.

I was raised religious and immediately equated the reason life is worth living with the promise of afterlife. 

Once that illusion was shattered early in highschool I turned to hard drugs to numb my pain and suppress my overactive thoughts. I was already depressed and self-medicating at 14.  From opiates to benzos, to uppers, weed, alcohol, I did whatever I could get my hands on. Then i tried psychedelics and magically my brain recreated for itself the illusion that there was a higher power. One that would promise me an afterlife by means of reincarnation. Took about 6 months for that intense psychosis to wear off and another year to repair myself from the lazy, entitled piece of shit it made me. 

I quit most of the drugs cold turkey by college except the occasional cigarette and a joint or two every other day. I guess you can never really alleviate the emptiness that opiate abuse leaves you with and I was well on my way to embracing it as part of who I am. 

Still, all this time I'm left without a goal that would satisfy me. No amount of fame, fortune, or sex would overshadow the cruelty of the nature of existence. It doesn't matter if for a moment my body is clean of toxins and all of my schedule is cleared off because then I'm reminded that I'm not working towards anything I care about. There are people who have created walls in their consciousness to block out the reality that life has no inherent meaning. Succesful people, who never accepted the cruel truth but I'm not made like that, I cant lie to myself. So I simultaneously accept my fate but feel a seething hatred towards it. 

Right now I'm in college with a damn near perfect gpa, working towards getting my degree and credential so I can teach. I can self evaluate and come up with so many reasons why I SHOULD want to do this. It plays to my strengths, soothes my existential fear of being forgotten, and the schedule is something everyone is accustomed to. It's the best goal I've found, but I still dread it. It's just going to be more work, week after week, crossing things off until I die.

 I've never felt accomplished in my life. Not after I have won trophies and awards for being the best at something. I've never really had an ego that said ""hey you should feel good about this"". When I was younger I would just thank God and defer to him, now I just instantly remember that it's all for naught. 

I think many people are dealing with a similar struggle to me, but so many don't feel its weight because of the spread of hedonism as an acceptable philosophy for life. I went through that stint with my use of drugs and it is a dark path that brings nothing to truly remedy your fears. 

Physical insecurities and emotional insecurities plague me day and night. I stay awake repulsed by my body and its inadequacies and have begun to fantasize about humiliating acts and it just digusts me more. Even with the emotional aspect I have cringey inner fantasies about having outbursts that I know would just alienate me. So I've developed a pretty good semi-passive persona to minimize my contact with those who make me nervous and a good enough fake confidence to where people dont whisper about me being weird. I'm sure everyone has their secrets, but if most people could see in my brain they'd reccomend euthanasia.  

If I had some dream of having a family or of being some particular type of person it would make it easier to deal with my problems. But I work, go to school, practice my instruments and still am reminded that I'm not working towards what I truly desire. 

Feeling loved always seems to be a high goal for people, but they also say never sacrifice your other goals for a relationship, and that the only unconditional love you recieve is from your parents. Well my mother died recently, as well as my grandmother, and the only person left is my dad who was abusive to me my whole life and I still live with him. Hes also dying though, so I'm already out of options there. 

I havent met a girl that I could bear to be in a relationship with ever. Either because of my own expectations or their expectations of me. I dont see myself being able to be a good husband. I cry every day and I literally will lay there on the floor weeping about the futility of existence just for the endorphins rush that follows. I couldnt be strong for someone elses problems when It takes everything I have to sort out my own. 

Really in the end there is no being saved. I could choose to save myself and put up with this shit for the rest of my life, which I probably will. But I will be unfulfilled and wracked with fear as I pass into death. No one will care that I chose to stick around, and I'll never be able to properly express just how much I wished for this world to be different. And it wouldnt matter. Wishing for reality to change is pathetic and far from noble even if I do wish others were alleviated of suffering as well.

so, in October of the last year i tried committing suicide by drinking 60 pills of several medicine i could find combined with alcohol. On the next day i ended up in the hospital and was unconscious for 48 hours before i woke up.

When i recovered i was sent right away to a psychiatrist in a different city, i did a depression test there and they concluded that **i don't have any depression.**

\- I mean am i really not depressed?

I told that psychiatrist everything, that i constantly feel like sh\*t and down, that i sleep for at least 10 hours a night, that the last time i was hanging out with anyone was around 15 months ago which was a short walk around the city, that my legs are completely covered up in razor scars, that i avoid talking with other people, that the only thing i do in my day is do nothing, then go to school, and do nothing afterwards, that i have massive memory issues that affect my studying all the time, that i'm unable to feel any emotion, that i get irritated by everything very easily, that i thought about killing myself many many times and so on and so on ...

Is it disgust? Maybe it's shame. I've never been good with self-control. Something both sides of my family struggle with.

I *want* to say that ever since moving to Vancouver 3 years ago I've been struggling with depression, self-discipline, mental health, drugs, making and keeping friends and making mature and wise decisions, but the truth is I have been this way for as long as I can remember. 

I can't pinpoint exactly where it all stems from but I have some pretty solid guesses as to the people, experiences and events in my past that helped create who I am today. The questions I ask are almost all unanswerable to a degree. Why do I struggle with romantic relationships? I could say it was because my mother left me when I was 8. Why did she leave me? I could say she couldn't deal with the pressure of having 3 children while dealing with the emotional anguish of having a mental health disorder. Why do I struggle with addiction and self harming behaviours? I could say it was due to a traumatic past that lead to me having to cope through any means necessary instead of facing my past and working through the pain instead of numbing it. I could say all of that. But how the fuck could I know any of that? And furthermore, if that's all true, how the fuck do I deal with it?

I'm so afraid of who Ive become today that I need mind altering substances to keep me from embarrassing myself when im sober. I regularly make statements online, in public when I'm sober of substance that I look back on after smoking some weed and cringe at. Often times whithin the *same day*. I try to get a point across that, in my mind, people take the wrong way. ""You guys just dont get it"" is a thought I have frequently. Do they not get it? Or are the things I'm saying or sharing coming from a place within myself I can't see? A place of grudge, anger, resentment or spite?

It seems whenever I think I am getting a grasp on it, it all goes to shit in a matter of minutes. Why do I keep saying and doing things that hurt me? Why have I always been a loner, striving for true connection in a world that continuously spirals into an abyss of selfishness and pride? Do I even know what the fuck I'm saying right now? Am I crazy?

I must be way more unlikable than I think because people plain don't like me. Like some people can see I'm doing my best to be a positive and upbeat person but I think those same people see whats going on behind it all that dont want to be around it. Whenever I go to a new environment with new people to meet and socialize, it seems like people always like me at first and slowly stop talking to me after realizing.....what? Am  I just a fucking asshole? Are my opinions so bad that people just see me as an over critical ass? Maybe im needy. The more I have these questions and the more I ponder my own person, I feel anger and pain building in my chest. I can physically feel it right now as I type because I just dont fucking understand how to fix the shitty things about myself that keep alienating the people around me and making them not want to have anything to do with me. a million and one examples are flooding through my head right now and some fucking voice saying ""dont take it personal"" but how the fuck do I not take it personal when its about my personality? I want to say ""no one cares about me"" and yeah, maybe thats true but does anyone care about anyone anymore? My abandoning mother wont even call me on my birthday. nor Christmas. she never asks how Im doing anymore. even when she left me she chimed in and gave me a call to see how life was over the years as I grew up without her influence. I move to Vancouver 3 years ago, where she lives, and Ive heard less from her than I did when I was in a different province. I know its not me. But fuck does it ever hurt when people tell me a mothers love is endless and strong when mine doesnt even know what my favourite colour is, or how old I am, or who my first love was, who my first heartbreak was. She blames my dad for who knows what and the few times I did talk to her since moving here, she asked me for money at the end of every conversation. Its been almost 30 years since I was born. almost 20 years since she left. still im as confused and angry as I was when it happened. 

No one cares. psychologists are paid to care, families are obligated and my friends...i have few to speak of. 

Where the fuck am i going with all of this? Like putting it down here right now is going to help me come up with the answer. The one thing I can do to make all my pain disappear when in reality this pain is either going to get worse or just stay dormant my entire life and Im just going to grow up wondering what could have been if everyone made different choices in the past. 

Open up to people these days and catch a look of ""why would I care"" or ""im not your therapist bro"". 

Im so fucked up and im scared im going to do something one day that fucks me up so bad I cant heal. one wrong batch of cocaine, one night of binge drinking leading to another razor incident except this time, I dont call the ambulance.

And making music isnt helping. in fact, making and sharing my music with others is crippling my self worth. I watch someone start a brand new venture and gain a large following within weeks where as Ive been making music for 3 years now and can barely get a comment on my work that isnt just a friend pandering so as not to hurt my feelings. Friend gets over 200 subscriber to youtube in 2 weeks, Ive had 25 for three years. But if I dont have music, what do I have? I cant take it lately and I feel like i get over dramatic but only because thats what I think others are thinking if I bring it up. either that or people just blow it off like ""yeah bud we all got problems"". life is cruel should i just accept it and move on? where do I even start to work on all of these problems? I feel like every day that passes Im losing people to turn to. I feel shame for not following through on things I say im going to do. I feel regret daily for stupid things ive said or done. I feel like a dipshit, needy asshole that cant figure it out and as a result the people around me get pissed off or just dont want to deal with being around me. 

I feel pathetic like i'm looking for pity or something from being emotionally beat down and lost. I feel like I havent had a win in a long time. I feel like im losing my passion and will to keep trekking when every time I try do something with my life, I fail as a result of my own shortcomings. Am I just ungrateful for what I have? What *do* I have?

My friend says I apologize too much. Is that cuz I need validation that what I did wasnt wrong? Why do I have such a guilty conscience? is it cuz I blame myself for what my mother did? Is blaming someone else better? Is blaming life bieng an unpredictably wild ride better? Jesus fucking christ I feel like shit today. empty. tired. drained. What happens next? 

im moving away for a bit to try and get my head straight. sober up for a while and focus on finding my self worth again. try not to worry about my failing music career and my overall failures as a person through out my life. 

I think what really made me realize i sucked was when a friend who has been in the music industry successfully for the last 3 decades who has listened to my music and seen how passionate I am about being a full time musician asked me to open a restaurant with him when Ive been trying to get him to help coach me as an artist and help me out that way as cooking is just there to pay the bills. Immediately my mind went to ""oh. I guess im just not good enough. again."" I know there's a more positive way to look at all this but I just cant see it right now. I keep fucking up over and over again like Im in an endless loop of bad decisions and behaviour and I cant get out. fuck I hate being in my twenties. I hate myself for things I dont have control over, how fucking counter intuitive is that? and I can see it, great! But just cuz i see my own problems doesnt mean i have the first clue how to fix them.  I'm going to get a lot of ""go to therapy"" comments I know. but im 26 and today I have $1.46 in the bank account for the next 4 days and no food, im $2000 in debt with no real specific skills to get a good job besides writing music, I work as a part time cook at almost minimum wage with no way to progress or make more money in one of the most expensive cities to live in in north america, I live illegally in a studio warehouse with no showers or kitchen and mooch off my girlfriend cuz im about as self sustaining as a 15 y/o. I'm a smart guy but I cant seem to think my way out of this fucking rut.

I don't know who in my real life to ask for help.

Had really bad social anxiety for years and years, that morphed into pretty scary dissociative/panic attack stuff and a resulting depression which all together made me get my ass on medication. I got really lucky and the first med worked for me. Been on that for almost 3 years now.

Currently, I'm taking that med at the max dose a doc will prescribe. I was basically the poster child for getting medicated; so much of my stuff cleared up. However, recently, I've started to notice a big dip in my mood. First I had some bad anxiety days that I truly hadn't seen in years, then some worse dissociative stuff that made me lose a few days. Now I'm going into the fourth week of just classic depression: nothing's making me feel happy or anything, I'm spaced out, I'm missing class, and I'm remembering or caring enough to do things like shower and brush my teeth or eat. I'm pretty devastated because I really thought these days were behind me. 

More about my situation: I'm 23, in an intense grad school program, living away from home and my friends. (Also relevant is that the particular med I'm on is somewhat notorious for bad with-drawl symptoms when trying to come off it). 

My question is: when do/did you guys feel that it was time to shake up meds? When are the side effects and potential risks of trying something new worth it to you?

I do admin for a hospital full time and the shift patterns are ridiculous. Three completely random 13 hour shifts per week, could be 7:30 - 20:30 or 19:30 - 08:30.

It hurts to have sex, it hurts so bad. 

I have retroactive jealousy OCD, it's really bad and when I got into my current relationship, I tried to avoid it by telling my boyfriend not to tell me anything about his past because it would only hurt me. He thought I didn't know what was best for me, so he told me everything after we had moved to a different state together. It was so bad, I was crying every single day and night for months. 

Things only got worse. We started our relationship with a mutual agreement not to look at porn because we both felt like it was cheating. He broke that agreement several times in the very beginning because he thought I was lying about my past (he had been cheated on and lied to in every relationship he had, and because of this wound up emotionally abusing me for the first 6ish months of our relationship) and so he tried to find porn of me online to prove it. After we moved together and he told me everything, he wanted to watch porn again. He thought watching it together would be fun and he wanted to watch it on his own too. 

Every time we watched it together, he would block my view and look at it while we were doing stuff. I don't even like porn, I think it's cringey and bad. I didn't like him watching it either. I think he might've started to get more and more extreme because of it. He was a self-admitted former porn addict and after he started watching it again, he started asking me to dirty talk about my own family members, and me doing stuff with them. He said he wasn't attracted to them but the taboo of it. But he admitted that on my birthday, when my mom took us on a trip and we were staying in the same hotel room, that he was ""kind of hoping"" something would happen. 

He started wanting to have a threesome with a woman ""for me"" because I'm bi. He wanted me to be excited about it and involved but he was the only one looking at Craigslist and Tinder, and he even messaged a girl pretending to be me! It made me so mad that he could've possibly thought it was about me when I wasn't even involved. Then he wanted an open relationship and said he wanted to be with women of all sorts of body types. He wasn't okay with me talking to other guys, but I could talk to girls. 

I tried but I wasn't interested. Eventually he let me talk to guys but I still didn't really want it. He didn't really like talking to other people either and claimed he was only interested in me but came back to ""I want to have sex with other women"" a few times. 

This whole time I was forcing myself to have sex, sometimes painful and emotionally damaging sex. I felt like I had to because of things my RJ OCD was telling me. He wouldn't even cuddle me after every time we had sex because he ""couldn't enjoy his orgasm"" if he did. So after sex he would go right back to whatever he was doing immediately. When he was working a job, he told me if I ever wanted to have sex, it would have to be quickies because he was too tired to ever give me foreplay. 

He's since stopped all these things and apologized when he realized how badly they all hurt me. But my body is broken, I don't get turned on anymore and every time I try to have sex, it feels like somebody is rubbing my insides with sandpaper. It doesn't go away with lube, I've tried. I think I might have PTSD (I've gone through a lot more trauma than just this) and trauma-induced vaginismus. I just want someone to know what I've been through and understand how bad it was for me. He's stopped doing those things for over a year now but it still hurts like it's still happening. I'm not sure how this will ever be fixed.

I have no post-secondary education, but I have a pretty good job I just started making $43k a year. I have been living with my mother since my parents split in 2014 and I now pay a small amount of rent. I have a small circle of friends, only one of which I ever see regularly, and we normally just go out to eat and that's it. I also have an extremely long-distance relationship which makes things very difficult since I have a high sex drive and can't satisfy my needs (story for another day). The purpose of this post is to seek advice for someone who always wants to be out doing something but has no one to do it with.

I work regular Monday-Friday hours, so I have the evenings to myself and the weekends also. I have tomorrow off, it being a national holiday, but I did nothing yesterday besides go eat and I see my friend today and you guessed it: we went to eat. I even work in the city which is flush with ""things to do"", but I can only do them with myself. The vast majority of my coworkers are older and I have almost nothing in common with them. I can't see going out with them. I'm not easy to make friends with either, due to my difficulty to open up to people and bizarre sense of humor and personality. 

My best friend is off in college hours away. Most of my friends from school have drifted away and don't seem to want me around. What is wrong with me? I always ask myself. Am I just that horrible? It honestly makes me feel like shit and so instead of feeling unwanted, I'd rather shut myself out and act like I want to be left alone (I'm self-aware enough to know that may be part of the problem). But really I don't. I want to do things. Even if we're just sitting at my kitchen table over a can of cola chatting about menial bullshit, I would love having some human company. Even if we're going to Walmart to buy car oil. Anything. But no one ever calls.

I know a lot of people my age practically live at bars, clubs and social events. But I can't remember the last time I've been to one. Not that that's the pinnacle of ""fun"" but it's a huge social aspect I have completely missed during my college-age years (again, I never went). So without an outlet to easily socialize, it's damn near impossible for me to make friends. As trashy as it is, many people meet partners for sex at those kinds of events too. A high sex drive and a long-distance relationship are a deadly combination. I've had to resist all kinds of temptation and pass opportunities to fulfill my shallow physical desires because I have a girlfriend who lives far away, and when I say far, I mean China. It's unbelievably frustrating but I love her and don't want to let her go so I can have random sex. Add to that, I've never ever had sex with someone I haven't met online makes me feel like a fucking loser with no game. I have gotten close to having sex with girls I've met in real life, but no cigar.

I've even tried to go out by myself and do stuff but it falls so flat. Who wants to go to a movie, dinner, concert, to get drinks, play minigolf or whatever by their lonesome to sulk in their thoughts? No one. And no one would want to approach someone for friendship who looks like such a ""weirdo"".

My career may be on a steady course to success, but what's the point if there's no one to celebrate with along the way? What's the point of bringing home progressively bigger paychecks if all you do once you get home is sit on the internet for hours and no one calls you up?

I hope someone who has experienced something similar can provide some guidance.

I think that was the reason why my appetite had lessen a lot, I would go two or three days without eating. I would only eat when I got annoyed of hearing my stomach growling, it was weird because I didn't feel hungry and I had no energy to make myself something to eat. I'm slowly getting my appetite back, but I can only eat a little before I feel full.

I didn't notice how much weight I lost until my therapist pointed it out to me, where I live there is a lot of meth usage. So, my therapist and social worker had believe I was using also. It made me angry that they would assume that, I would never touch that stuff. It can do a lot of damage to people's relationships, their bodies, and their mental health.

I'm writing this as it has been pretty evident that my depression has been affecting my loved ones around me, especially my boyfriend.

I see that people who love me try to help me and make me feel better, but I hate that I'm bringing them down. 

I cant do, much less enjoy, activities that I used to. Things that my boyfriend and I did when I was in a mentally healthier state seem so difficult now. Hes extremely supportive, and has shared that this is something he is gladly choosing. 

However, it sucks when I see that he worries about me and tries to make me feel better with not much success. I've tried to share that it is something I am working at and will take a while, however I wonder if him being (a) discouraged because I am not always receptive/easily triggered by some past trauma that normal activities can cause (b) worrying about me and my mental health is getting too much. 

It hurts me to see him hurt alongside me. I feel horrible for being the needier, depressed individual in the relationship. 

I wish I could give more.. but I sometimes wonder if it is better for me to separate myself and my issues from him because then he'd be free of what I'm experiencing and having to support me..

As time went on, she continued doing this and he continued to respond although I told her and him to stop. So I snapped, I was beyond frustrated. We broke up, and I cut her off. I told this person, AM, who's supposedly my best friend to block her to. So 5 months later, I notice that MB is back on his Facebook and they are talking. Also playing games together frequently on PlayStation. So of course I get angry, months and months go by and this person who's my best friend is hanging out with this girl who broke my fucking heart as if nothing happened, taking selfies and everything. So I snapped, and texted him, basically saying he and her can go fuck themselves and I blocked him.

I'm so over dating and relationships, and I'm so over these fake friends who act cool but wanna fuck your girl low-key. This shit is why I keep all my business on the low.

I'm not even entirely sure why I'm doing this in the first place, or if this is even the correct place for me to post, but here I am nevertheless. Maybe I want advice, maybe I just need to rant (and I guess visibly, rather than privately), or who even knows.

I'm not even really sure how to start this or what I intend to type, so please pardon any grammatical/punctuation errors that may be present as I begin to just... spew.

I'm more than halfway through my college education, and I don't know how I've been feeling as of late. I think I'm just not happy, but I don't even fully know why that would be the case. From what I can understand, I surely haven't had a difficult life or many pressing events that would validate these emotions I have, which just makes the situation even more confusing.

I feel I've gotten worse the last several or so months, specifically. Thoughts have gotten darker and negative moods have become more commonplace. Maybe it's just loneliness - I'm not well connected here, and what connections I do have, I don't believe are anything significant, if even positive, as I'm always worried it's fake or superficial - out of pity - which my gut often tells me it/they are. I feel like there's more to it, but maybe I'm just more emotionally volatile than I am aware, or just melodramatic, which worries me even more. 

I'm at the point in which I don't really like the person I am, all in all, such as who I see in the mirror, who I hear in my head (figuratively), the person making decisions for me. 

I'm already terrified of the future - and may live too much of my life in the past - as I struggle to even figure-out what I want to do in my life after college, since I barely seem to know myself at times, even though I AM me. I barely have any hobbies or interests it seems, and while I have recently attempted to do more in my life, both personally and socially, I don't seem to be finding much success.

Whatever this feeling is, it seems to be bleeding into other parts of my life. Even on breaks and during holidays, there seems to be an effect - Christmas and the whole holiday season never felt like this years prior, and I don't know if that is because of this, or some connection I'm unable to see. 

I want stability. I want friends. I want to do new things. I want to learn new things. I want whatever this is I seem to be experiencing to be over with. I want *something, anything,* and I don't even know if what I'm listing is what I need, rather than want. I almost feel selfish, somewhat ridiculous and pathetic, as I type this all out. Maybe what I want is just someone or something to connect to, leading me here. Support, but at the same time, I don't know anymore.

If there is something wrong, and that this isn't ""normal,"" then what am I to even do. This is all I seem to know recently, and I'm worried if that I'm to go to ""normal,"" or become who I'm ""supposed to be(?),"" then I won't even recognize who that individual is anymore. What if I also am unable to come to terms with who I am after such a change? Would that mean there was nothing that could be done, and that it was for nothing?

I'm not even sure how to fully encapsulate the entirety of my situation in a singular post, or words alone, as even what I have written now seems most definitely incomplete, but I don't even know what else to put, or how to continue. I'm not even comfortable putting too much in such a public space, but felt the need to put something.

I apologize if you have read the entirety of this and feel as if I have wasted your time. Maybe it's related to depression, maybe in the end, it's not at all...

I am stressed constantly and have been since the beginning of the winter/holiday break. I feel guilty for taking the time to relax and recharge or spend time with friends since I could be using this time to work. I also know that I can't work 24/7 without serious burnout, which I already feel coming on for the term. I feel on the brink of tears and have racing thoughts nearly all the time, and when I don't I just feel numb, tired, and just go to sleep.

Along with these issues mentally, I am in a long-distance relationship with my lovely and supportive SO of 4.5 years, and essentially in LDRs with all of my friends back home, over a thousand miles away. While I like my coworkers and the other first-year students in my program, I feel like my social needs for connection and physical affection/support are not being met. With my mental state and schedule, I feel like a pet is out of the question; I can hardly take care of myself. Sometimes it's just nice to have someone to sob to while being held. Phone calls and texts and video calls can't compare to getting lunch, staying up late watching movies, and chatting for hours about all of our deepest feelings while braiding each others' hair.

I feel constantly like a burden to everyone around me and that I am too intense or am asking for too much when I spend time with people, so I've been withdrawing from bigger social events. Some of the people I've felt closest to seem to resent me, but it could also just be me telling myself these things.

I know that I likely have been depressed for some time, along with anxiety of some flavor, but I'm not one to self-diagnose. I have been trying to get a therapist since I started classes this past fall, but it took a month to prep myself to talk with the mental health resources office. I was then deferred to outside therapists. All of the ones I have contacted have had full books, so I am on multiple waitlists now. It all just makes me want to quit trying and that it's all hopeless and that I can never expect to get better.

It feels nice to get this all out into the void of the internet, but it'd also be nice to know I'm not alone and that it will eventually get better somehow. I feel like I'm naturally an optimist in the long-term, but the short-term outlook just feels so bleak right now.

***TLDR***: I'm a first-year Ph.D. student, feeling completely overwhelmed with work, socially not having my needs met, and I feel like I'm at my breaking point.

Since I was a kid, I've always been an outsider and as I grew up, I didn't fit in with the most. I saw people around me having lots of friends, dates and boyfriends, sexual experiences, parties, popularity on social media, and I literally never experienced any of that. Bullying came through and people would eventually say ""your time will come"", reducing me to nothing, and I thought that it was okay, it was fine, and then, I suffered in silence. But the more I saw people around me having it all, the more I felt abnormal.

I always wanted to understand the reason why I never was *normal*, I wasn't ""stupid and made bad decisions"", I was in therapy, I really tried to do my best, but my best never seemed to be enough. So, I tried to end myself in June last year. I survived and was hospitalized.

Now, college will start in a month, I'm doing therapy, but I still think I'm living in vain. My 3 friends show me how they get everything through social media, like, Instagram, Twitter, Tinder and etc., but the more I try to be someone on it, the more it feels like I'm living in a cyber stockholm syndrome. I know it's unproductive to deal with the past, but I think that I'm constantly losing time because of the days that go by, and I'm still absent from it all. I truly want to get better, to see that there's more to live.

So here I am. 

20.01.2020. First entry.

I keep falling into this endless loop of nothingness. Nothing worries me anymore. There’s nothing I care about anymore. I am not bored, I don’t think I am depressed, I went into full auto mode and just continue my daily routine, reliving the same day over and over. My girlfriend suggested than writing some form of diary might help so here I am.

There are so many things I want to do but keep saying to myself that I will do them on some other day. Some of these things are very basic like watching movies that seem interesting or reading that book which may give some new food for thoughts. I am truly amazed by my level of unmotivation.

I want to code program new projects, I want to learn a new speaking language like german or czech, I want to study biology and chemistry or continue my math education, but at the same time *I don’t want to because I don’t care*. 

Right now I am wondering if this diary will at least contain more than one entry since tomorrow I will most likely be too lazy to write the next one.

And even if I do continue writing it most likely will be just a long rant about self reflection since nothing interesting is happening in my life. Maybe it’s a good idea to share it with someone. No even friends or relatives, just random people on internet will do.

I hear that in the kitchen the kettle is finishing boiling water for the tea which I don’t even want to drink. This tea is the same part of my routing as everything else. 

I started smoking. And every time I smoke I think about how my past self would be terrified by what I became. I used to have so much ambitions, so much desire to live and work but now it’s all gone. I guess that’s something to worry about *but I don’t care*.

Good thing just happened. I created a second account on reddit to share this diary because I don’t want that stuff on my main account. Guess there is still something I care about. Or it’s just a sign of how scared I am to publicly admit that I am not ok.

I grew up with a lot of familial, financial and mental instability; left high school in 11th grade, never graduated HS, moved around high schools 4 times, never had any parental guidance and little support. I managed to get into a college somehow. I struggled so much in college, and now have a very low GPA and I made very few friends, no one I’d consider a close friend. I’ve been financially independent for a few years now and have mostly survived off of student loans and what little I earn from restaurant jobs, though I’m currently unemployed because my depression has been so severe lately I could not go to work. I’m graduating soon. As of right now, I have very few friends (most are living very far away from me), no job, no relevant professional experience, and absolutely no money (I guess I’m deep in student debt, actually), and I’m struggling so fiercely with crippling depression. 

If I do manage to graduate in a few months, I’m unsure of what I’d do. I have nowhere to go, no home to go to, no money to afford anyplace right away, no job, and no friends to stay with. My severe suicidality and depression hindered me from thinking and planning for the future much, and so looking forward, I feel quite lost and alone. I’m aware that the world we live in and the economic systems we toil under do not ascertain any basic needs for individuals and do not look favorably upon those who are poor and mentally ill. I am trying to treat my depression better, but I am still quite afraid. Any guidance would be immensely appreciated. I fear that I will be homeless and perish at some point soon...

Im interested to hear about others’ experiences, thoughts, etc. on ECT for depression.

My story is this : I received between 15-20 electroshock treatments over approx one month in late 2014. I continued to work while receiving treatments, per my doctors’ advice, but suffered severe memory loss eventually forcing me off work for a couple months. My memory from the year or so before my ECT is completely gone and never came back. It was also really stressful in the aftermath once I realized what was going on a few months post-ECT and had to return to work with really bad memory loss and zero confidence. 

THAT BEING SAID, in the years after my ECT even though my depression was never gone, it was manageable. I was able to go back to work in a demanding job and perform until about 2 months ago when my depression really crashed and I attempted suicide, landing me in the hospital for a couple weeks.  The doctor has changed my medications and I’m doing therapy and forcing whatever daily exercise I can manage but I still feel lower than I ever remember feeling before. I’m still off work and at home because the depression is bad. I’m at my breaking point and considering asking my doctor about trying ECT again.I guess I know what to expect now and maybe it helped for a couple years? I’m not sure.

Yeah ok that's bullshit. I'm the kind of person who keeps it in all the time. Last year, after years of hiding, I told my closest friends, which included my best friend/then boyfriend, that I wasn't doing well and was having mental health issues. They never suspected me of having it.  


Three weeks later, I had a second suicide attempt that resulted in me having to be picked up by ambulance. I was in the UK for studies, so I didn't have any family coming to check up on me or anything. Ended up in a psychiatric ward. I had told my friends what happened. Some said they'd come visit me. Others kinda tiptoed around visiting me, even though I screened the hospital address to everyone.   


It only took two weeks for all of them to stop talking to me. No, I didn't say 'keep talking to me or else I'll kill myself'. After telling them I was in the hospital, I tried to keep that talk to a minimum. They asked occassionally if I was still suicidal and I said yes all the time but didn't want to go into details.  


Since then, not a single one of them has even tried to contact me. I deleted most of my social media except for Facebook, which I've not updated and my status never says 'active' anymore. I realised today, if I had a friend I knew who was suicidal and used to be social-media-obsessed suddenly delete everything and remained inactive, I'd be pretty worried.  


But no. No one tried to contact any of my family or other friends. The only one who did only did so because coincidentally, the day she sent me an apology for not speaking was the day she got fired from her job. She doesn't have many friends who were willing to hear her vent about things other than me. Well, now that she needs someone to vent to, she decides to apologize.  


I could have easily been successful in one of my suicide attempts and been dead by now, but none of them would have known. Or cared. Never mind that, I'm still not doing well and I've been forced to move back with my parents. And all my friends knew I didn't have the healthiest relationship with them. None of them would even care to know nothing's changed. I've perfected the art of pretending it has but it hasn't, not at all, not even a little bit.

I never post on reddit so I don't really know how it works. 

I thought I had gotten over having those days where I can't even get out of bed because I'm so depressed that my body feels too heavy to even move and the slightest task seems insurmountable. But today was like that again. I need to do laundry but only succeeded in grabbing the laundry soap from the cupboard. I need to shower but can't even get undressed. I'm hungry but didn't even have the energy to wash a bowl so I could have cereal. I can't kill myself because I'm afraid of how painful it would be and the repercussions if I fail and of how much it'll affect my mom who has already lost two siblings and a nephew to suicide. But I spend a lot of my time wishing I could. 

I was fantasizing about killing myself when the phone call came in. I was trying to convince myself that no one would really miss me. My self esteem is already shit and I feel like all my friends only hang out with me because they feel sorry for me not because they actually enjoy my company. Most times I really feel like literally no one likes being around me and they just act like it to be polite. But while I was feeling this way, one of my friends randomly called me. I almost didn't answer the phone too because I had no social energy in me. But I also am afraid of letting people know I'm depressed so I figured it'd be better to answer and act like everything is okay. It turned out he was just calling to let me know about a new gym that had opened up in our area and was having a deal. He chose to call me because he knew I like going to the gym. I don't know why, but the idea that something that small made him think of me enough to call me and let me know just made me so emotional. After we hung up I just dropped to the floor and broke down crying. 

I don't really know what the point of posting this was to be honest. I just felt like I had to tell someone but, like I said, I'm not good with letting people know I'm depressed. Also, I'm kinda hoping this helps anyone who feels the same way. I genuinely think of myself as such a boring, uninteresting, awful person that no one could enjoy being around. But I don't know, the fact that I popped into this guy's head after something as simple as a new gym opening made me feel like maybe that's not the case.

I dont sing to my favorite songs anymore  

I am constantly thinking about suicide. constantly. I know I cant do it, because it would devastate my family and friends. I dont want to do that. especially since my sister has already died young and from similar issues. I cant just put my family through that again.

But even my family im losing faith in and I fear one day that I wont care enough to stay alive for them.

I should go back on meds. but the other part of me hates taking pills and I think they just fuck me up even more. and I dont even know if I want to seek therapy again because its always the same shit. some person sitting there getting paid for me to talk. and what am I going to say? ""I'm sad."" ""why?"" ""I dont know."" and I just dont have time for it, and on top of that I'd have to pay money for it. money that I really dont want to spend.

And i have been so busy hiding from it. Trying. But, there is no pushing things like that aside. I knew that, too. I think maybe pretending I could pull a sheet over it, cover it up, was the closest to a fight I could give. Truth is, under that sheet, the monster is still moving - just a layer below. And maybe more dangerous. I wonder, with concern, how I can fight what’s inside me, when I’m not quite sure what it is. I mean, what is a feeling? Does it originate within us, or does it come from the outside. Or is it a partnership. 
If from within, i’d be at war with myself. Or I already have been. If from the outside, from where, and how can i stop that machine, the cogs from moving?

If both, how do i know which came first? 
If they ever came at all, or where from. 

If anything, how can i stop it without the energy to stand? 

You see, no matter what way you look at it: 
my enemy is faceless, unknown. So ruthless and violent and unforgiving; it does not care how tired i am. How happy I’d like to be. How much it hurts others. It does not care for you or me. It has come to crush, and it has crushed. It silenced the little boy inside of me, and it continues to drown the man I want to be. 

So i thought if i couldn’t fight it, hide it. But that has proven equally exhausting as a fight with a ghost may have been, be. 


So many questions will always sit, unsettled in my heart over this. What if i had, had not? What if i did, did not? 

Will this always be a part of me? 
Will I always be this? 

Questions I cannot mute, but have tried to. Desperately. By speaking for everyone else, never myself

Now my silence has become so loud. I have to pull the sheet away and throw punches into the wind, hoping one connects with what’s killing me. 

A part of me says, tuck your tears away. The other part, let them flow freely. 

tuck them in, I drown.
Let them out, I feel like I’ll drown and drown everyone else around me too. 

But 
i’m just tired 
just tired of trying to be strong. I can’t even be sure who I was trying to be strong for. 

this is all to say, i woke up this morning weak. i woke up in need. 

so, i’m going to find that. I can’t kill this on my own. I can’t drown it in the bottle. I have to fight, but I need help. That is the hardest thing I’ll have to ever admit. I can’t handle this with my own two hands. Please understand that in this dark time for me. I just need some help.

Since I was really young I had a really difficult relationship with my parents, my father was really distant and verbally aggressive, he said multiple times during my childhood that I was just a problem in his life and my and my sister just made his life worse ( I am an accidental birth guy), it made me a really insecure child and my mother was a narcissist parent, it was really difficult grown old my grandmother was the only person that I could look up for affection and care. 

In my early teen years my father was basically absent because of his work and my mother was totally obsessed with my grades and college course choice. I was good student but all that pressure simple made me nuts, I had severe anxiety but if my grades were fine everything was fine, until a day that I just lose it and had a panic attack in my little brother party. I mean to all my relatives I was a polite and good teen(15 years old) so seen me going nuts and bursting into tears made them really woried.

After that I start seen a therapist, and I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and agoraphobia. 

My disorders really made it extremely difficult to have a normal social life and my medicines weren't being effective after 6 months I started getting worse and was diagnosed with depression my grandmother changed my therapist  and I started new meds.

Fast forward 3 years in my life I was having great improvements in my treatment and in my mental health, my meds were working, I had a part-time job, was dating a girl that now is my girlfriend, and had just passed in the high school national test and had had great grades so I was just waiting to my college admission (in not from US). Basically everything was going well but for reasons that I don't know my father was being a pain in the ass, always complaining about thing and starting to be aggressive towards my mother and my sister, one day he was being aggressive and I stepped up and confronted him, I said that I wouldn't let him yell at them nor treat them and if he wanted I would fight him. My father yelled at me but I yelled back and I think that the fact that I was now a grown ass man clicked in his head and he calmed down and apologized. After that my mother and siste were pissed at my because they said I shouldn't confront my father. I felt angry, because I had just defended then and they where pissed at me.

In some months I simply could not stand being in my house anymore, beyond the fights, my parents were always underestimating my illness and blaming other things than themselves as the cause of my depression, not being religious, playing video games (?) And thing like that so I just couldn't handle it anymore.

When I was 18 I started college and moved from my parents house to my grandmothers house, it was one of the best decisions of my life living almost 3 years here was just great, my therapist lowered my medicine dosage, I am feeling great, made new friends, currently having a great relationship.

My mother comes to my grandmother house often, at least 1 time in the week to have dinner and thing like that, I speak to her normally but it always come to the same subject, she wants me to come back home because my father miss me (?). I am not really resentful towards my mother but I am towards my father and we really never had a father-son bond after I grownup, so he sadnnes doesn't really worry me.

The problems is, in a recent family trip I discovered that my sister thinks that I am a ungrateful prick and my mother seems to support he to certain degree. I felt really bad about it because the emotional scars that my father left on my made me feel insecure most of my life. I was so angry that for everyone in the family I am ungrateful and my father is just the good guy.

I don't want any approval or take revenge on my father I just want to by left alone by then, those days are being the worst in my life since I started having panic attacks, my girlfriend is being really great and comprehensive but I can't help don't feeling  like thras and that maybe they are right. The last week I spent crying and being fucking anxious about things.

I'm sitting in my bathroom done with my parents, specially my mom. Everyday it's been hell of living, I don't even know where to start. I can't find a valid reason to still continue, I don't believe in God so life in heaven is false for me.

The reason why I'm here is because I had a fight, I have been fighting with them a lot lately, and also been really mad. I can't even type, I'm mentally and emotionally done, I'm exhausted.

Everytime I talk to them ends on a fight, it's my fault too, I'm not capable of saying sorry when I'm wrong and they also are also not capable of recognising their errors. But idk, I don't want to say it, I have a heavy resentment on them.

I feel lonely and scare of feeling like that, I made friends at uni but I dropped so I could study another career with the finacially support of my parents. I don't want to bother them, so that's why I'm here. Since I fought with them again, they won't help me. I know, I'm shit, pathetic. All I do is bother, I made my mom cry of anger, she's also done.

I have suggested attending a psychologist, my sister made an appointment but none of them didn't want to go. Their excuse was: ""we don't have time"". It's always like this, they spend more time in a fucking cult.

They think the know us, but they don't. They think that giving us materialistic things will fill us and in that way we need to be thankful, but I don't feel it in that way.

The reason we fought today was because a notebook. That was a present from my friend, she gave it to me when we finished our final project. All of my friends supported me emotionally, but my family didn't even know what I was doing at that moment. It has a meaning and when I realized my mom was using it, I got mad and yelled at her, I know it is a shitty reason to be mad but IT HAS A MEANING. The things my parents give me are good too, but they just do it because they want something from me, these are not meaningful. 

We lack of communication and I don't feel the love from them.

Tonight -- as I was putting away clean dishes -- I suddenly realized how far I've come since October.

I've suffered from MDD and anxiety for my whole adult life. That is almost 16 years. I have major gaps in my memory, including not remembering 90% of my childhood. Most of everything that happened in 2019 is gone from my brain so my timelines are all screwed up. Don't think I can recall a time I was ever truly happy in the last 10 years because the paranoia from anxiety makes sure I sabotage all my relationships, too. My marriage from 2008 to 2013 didn't survive due to my under-treated depression and he was undiagnosed bipolar. It was a toxic relationship of two people with unmanaged mental health issues. Divorce made my depression worse so I have stewed in my woes for the last 7 years. I was trying to find happiness from others by dating a bunch of guys without fixing my happiness first. I dated guys who I thought were ""good guys,"" but they either couldn't cope with my baggage or did a *hump n dump*. I gave up dating three years ago because getting used or rejected just made me feel worse. Amazingly, I have been able to hold steady employment and support myself financially over the years. However, I would just sleep during most of my free time or watch TV to stop me from disassociating. Only got up to feed my dog or let her outside. Sometimes my dog would shit in the house so I would just roll over and go back to sleep because I was too exhausted or sad to get up. Meanwhile I would always feel like a bad friend, sister/aunt/daughter, and dog owner because I have not been doing jack shit with my life. I barely have any friends left to call ""friends,"" who I never see.

I finally got fed up and saw my doctor the week before Halloween. She put me on Prozac then we added Wellbutrin in December to help my binge and overeating tendencies.

The dishes are done and put away. The floors are clean. The laundry is done. The trash has been taken out. Grocery shopping is done. I made and hung a custom blackout panel for my bedroom window. Curtain rod and curtains are up over the blackout panel. I cleaned my kitchen sink and bathroom. I bought a pair of walking shoes so I can start taking short walks during my lunch breaks. I am down 10 pounds in four months just from eating less. I have a list of keto meals planned for this week and will be meal prepping tomorrow on my day off.

Never thought I would say antidepressants would save my life or at least make it better. I feel stupid for avoiding them for so long but I will forgive myself because I can't change the past. I have a list of goals to accomplish this year and think I can actually check them all off because I am feeling better than I have in years.

Alot of people who are very smart, as a result of their awesomeness, are deficient in many other areas.

Like who cares if your smart if you have premature social skills amirite? That is the beauty of nature. Few are born with both, because we all have our own *unique* roles to fill in this world. It is OK to not know what that role is yet! Trust me, I dont! But you have to atleast try to look for opportunities. 

My depression and anxiety has been so debilitating the past 6 years, I have relied on manic job applications and sheer hope to get a single job (which i failed to keep), and I have become increasingly introverted to the point where I am the quiet one again. I still know myself as that loud ass kid who burst peoples eardrums. 

If you don’t think you are very intelligent, I encourage anyone who reads this to start journaling. I do it on my notes app to make it easy and accessible.

We moved to America when I was 3. I believe my parents are both clinically diagnosable as being mentally retarded, and yet somehow my dad still gets a degree. We moved to America purely so my dad could finish his degree (but he always tried to tell me it was for me and not him). Like in many parts of Asia, getting an education is the ultimate trump card, no matter your passion in the subject or anything. He never worked a single second, and for the 10 years we were in America, my mom supported us through illegal jobs. My school experience was mostly disastrous, and my dad would punish me for it. My mother was never allowed to do anything of her own will - not even drive to the store alone. My dad would throw tantrums. He managed all the money that she earned.

I'm a 16 year old Male who deals with Generalized Anciety Disorder, Depression and minor Autism. I'm actually an okay looking guy, I'm 5'10"", dirty blonde hair (hair looks a bit like Justin Bieber), clean skin. One problem I have is how skinny I am.  I understand if people are like ""being skinny isn't a bad thing"" because most people would not see it as a bad thing. The problem is, I'm 5'10"" and 115 pounds. It is a cause for insecurity enough to the point I would rather be fat because the teasing would at least not be to my face. 

Anyway, that's enough about me and the basics. I'm a musician, rapper actually. I rap in some very old school styles, despite the very minor lisp I deal with I try to keep my annunciation very clear. I like rapping fast and am currently working on a clean version of Eminem's new ""Godzilla"" verse. I do more than just rap, I want to produce and I have learnt a lot of music theory to go along with that. My dream is to be able to live off of music, preferably as a rapper, but in any way I can. 

Now onto the real problem. I'm lonely. I'm actually  really fashionable, I wear black glasses, and I color coordinate my outfits to make my shoes pop out, and still look ""attractive"". I have a lot of friends, and a family I live with. You would think everything is going okay with someone like me, right? In reality I'm stuck in a wall if darkness and emptiness. I've gotten really fake. I used to be able to share my emotions, now I act like I'm happy all the time (There is a story to this, and how it came to be, and I'll share that next). I have all the love in the world, except for one kind. I'm not in a romantic relationship, and haven't been for a long time. That's probably stupid, but its true. It kinda seems like I'm everyone's second choice, but no ones first choice.

Now, here's the story of why I've become fake. In November of 2018 I got into a brutal fight with my girlfriend, my only real girlfriend, the only person who has ever cared for me how she did. These fights started becoming a thing because she and I were both hard headed people. Finally, on December 20th, 2018, we broke up, and she completely cut me off. It hurt, it hurt a lot. Not too long after, in March, I started to fall for someone else. This girl, we'll call her Amber for privacy sakes (mainly cause all Amber's seem to be crazy). Amber is the most beautiful girl I've ever met. Shes about 5'4"", she's skinny yet somehow curvy, she has beautiful blue eyes and long, flowing brown hair. She saved my life in July of 2018 (a story for another time) and when I started catching feelings for her, that was one of the main reasons. I worked up the courage to ask her on a date, and she gave me an answer I would learn to dread. ""Yes, but wait. I'm not ready yet."" I waited, and about 2 months later I asked again, and she said yes. However, the day before we were set to go she told me her dad decided that he wanted me to ask him first. Kinda convenient, right? So I did again, and had to wait FOUR MONTHS, before recieving an answer. So, I said screw it and asked her if she and I could be a thing. She said yes, but guess what came after it. If you said, ""yes, but wait. I'm not ready,"" you are correct! December 8th rolled around. Kinda funny how bad stuff always seems to happen right before Christmas. I was handed a note. This note read that she had been lying about being interested in me this whole time. I had been waiting since March, and we were getting closer and closer, only to find out it was all a lie.

I loved her. Correction. I love her. Everyone thinks I'm over her, I have a date to an upcoming Formal dance. I'm ""happy"". Even Amber thinks I'm happy. Only 3 or 4 people know I'm not really happy. However, I'm quickly discovering that the girl I'm taking to the dance isn't interested in me the same way I am in her. Its leaving this empty spot in my heart. It clouds my mind because nothing feels right without that spot being filled up. 

Is it stupid to feel empty over this? One of the few people who know how I felt held my hand recently (as a support gesture, she is dating my best friend), and told me she felt my pain through just that.

Depression and IQ have a positive correlation. This means that with intelligence comes increased risk for depression and anxiety. Y’all are probably some really smart motherfuckers

People with bad depression may also feel they have inadequate or immature social skills (or is it just me) and to that i say “you cant be charismatic if your so amazingly smart!” Cant have two great things in one! Thats just the nature of it all. Pick one or the other! Im okay with learning social skills ya know ;)

Therapy saves lives when you are open and accepting to it. And don’t expect you to get anywhere if you don’t like your therapist either!
a therapist that you are *compatible* with is SOO important if you have a support system that cannot meet your emotional needs. Even if you have the best friends and family in the world, a therapist is that much more important to have on hand if your support system ever becomes your very problem.

Debilitating depression is real, and sometimes, its only those spur of the moment things and impulse decisions that progress us through life

If you are contemplating suicidal or have a plan for suicide, partial or complete hospitalization is nothing to be ashamed of. A bed in a psych ward can be healing for a reasonable amount of time, and hopefully after treatment, you emerge a more hopeful and mindful person.
This chance of happening becomes real slim when you are opposed to therapy in any way. find the right professional for YOU.

Some of you may know me, some may not. I guess it’s not as important as to who I am, but rather how I got here, I guess.

I was having a normal life up until five or six years ago, when I was twelve or thirteen. My dad and thyroid cancer, and had to get it removed. I was worried for a bit, bug the surgery ended fine with no complications. The problems would come up a year later.

My parents had just got into an accident in October of 2015, and the fault was far from theirs. The bastard who hit them even admitted he was looking at his phone before he hit them, and hat hit another car trying to flee the scene. Neither my mom or dad had any severe injuries, just some real bad bruising. I think, however, that my dad suffered a head injury, because he changed in a bad way after the accident.

He stopped taking his thyroid medication, and started to become more erratic and quick to anger. I mean, he wasn’t the type of guy to hug my every time I scraped my knees, but he still cared for me immensely, me being his only son. When he stopped taking his medicine, however, I noticed he became even more gruff. He started to abuse my mom around this time, though I didn’t notice. 

Things were starting to get worse in the months to come. He was getting more erratic, more abrasive, and started to drink again, which he hadn’t done for nearly a decade at the time. He took his medicine less and less, up to a point where he stopped taking it altogether. Fights between him and mom were becoming more and more common place, to the point we’d stay on the other side of town for a night or two to let him calm down.

On New Year’s Day of 2016, things changed for the worse. We went over to my grandmas as my parents were fighting again, and mom wanted me away from that. It was about two in the morning when he started banging on the door, demanding to see us. My grandma called the cops to send him away. Before he left, I went out to talk to him, and he embraced me in a hug and cried into my shoulder, “Don’t forget me.” He cried like a baby. I don’t think I’ll ever forget how weak and vulnerable he was.

Skip a few months and my parents trying to work things out, I went to my aunts (moms side) house to work for her during the summer for a week or two. Two turned to three, and I eventually asked her why. She told me abruptly and unapologetically that my dad had spread gasoline over the floor of the house, and had threatened to burn it down with her inside.

Come that fall, my parents were fully split up and my mom had ordered a restraining order on him. He thought it was a ploy to sleep with his friend, the dad of one of my friends, and ran back town with a sinister plan in mind. He went to their house, with a lead pipe, and tried to kill him. Luckily, my friends dad held up his arm, which I don’t think broke (I wasn’t told much), but had put a deep hash in his harm. My dad was arrested an hour later for attempted manslaughter. A few months later, my mom divorced him. It was the end of 2017. 

Around that time, my mom tried to find someone new to fill in that gap. Eventually she did. My eventual step dad was almost an exact copy for my dad, except he didn’t have his thyroid replaced. He had a son around my age, who would become my step brother. I knew right away that I didn’t like them, simply of because how similar they were to my dad, but if mom was happy, so was I. He was a good man for a while, and he knew his limits around me. I even told him I would never call him dad, only by his name, and he was fine with that.

Then came his arrest. He was from Houston, and had come up north during all the flooding that happened. What he forgot to do, however, was to tell his parole officer where he was going during the time. After he forgot to check in, a warrant was issued for his arrest. Around that time, I was visiting my biological dad, as he was in the county jail before he was shipped to another jail in Abilene. He tricked me into telling him who moms “new flame was”, and eventually told the police where he was: at my house.

A few weeks go by, and he is finally sent to Abilene. I was at trapshooting practice at the time, so I didn’t get to say goodbye. After I came home, I found a police cruiser at the bus stop. The cop who was waiting for me was a well-known asshole whom everyone in my small town disliked. He had just come back from taking my dad from Abilene, and he had told the cop where my step-dad was. The cop came to me for leverage. He asked me if I knew where SD was, and for some unknown reason, even to me, I said no. That’s when he told me, “Look, son, be straight with me. If I find SD at your house, your mom will go to jail for harboring a fugitive.” So I told him the truth. I come home to find SD being escorted in handcuffs out of the house, and I couldn’t help but apologize to him.

Come around January 2018, my dog of ten years has to be put down due to heart complications, and I go to my aunts for what was supposed to be a few days. It ended up being a week, with me missing the first week of school for the new year. SD was still in jail, and I think this was when I first started becoming really depressed. My grades never really ‘tanked’ at school when I got back, but everyone seemed to notice, even my special ed teacher. I only got positive reinforcement to hold back my depression, which was enough.

Towards the end of that January, my SD proposed to my mom, and my SB moved in. That March SD was released for good behavior, and went to a nearby pit bull breeder (what my previous dog was) with my mom to get me a puppy, who I still have now, and is even lying in bed with my as i type. In April, SD and mom got officially married. This is when problems started to rise, again.

SD had promised me and SB that he would help us do chores, especially since we went to school most of the time. Never did it. After I called him out on breaking his promise, he said he would only help us if he saw us doing chores. Never did that either.

Skip a few months of SD not fulfilling promises, SB calling me and a friend some homosexual expletives, and Christmas rolls around. Everything was going well, until SD gave a ring to mom. She said it look small, but in the sense that a) it looked fragile and b) might not fit her. SD took it as she didn’t like the size of the gem, and blew up and started shouting. Almost punched my SB, and stormed off, threatening to leave my mom. After after a week of him cooling off, he came back and apologized.

The first week of January 2019, he was arrested for drug trafficking. He never found a job, so he resorted to that. A week later, my mom found out that SB was cheating on her with his ex-wife, whom tried to kill him. My birthday comes around, I am diagnosed with depression proper and am prescribed medicine. That summer, my SB just up and left, saying that mom was “being rude” to him.

Now, nearly a year later, rarely being consistent with my meds, and now being a day or two without them, here I am, recounting it all to you, whoever is reading this.

Simple fears like what does this person think about me, the uncertainty of the future, or failure. The fear that controls me the most is ""the cycle repeating itself"". For context I've been suffering of constant depression throughout 5 years, I've been on an uphill battle in which the cycle always repeated. Half the year was great, the other half was terrible, and I was naive and immature(I was 13 when it all started). So first half, I always started hopeful and said ""I will turn this around"" but things sometimes happen at the worst possible moment, and so I fell once more. Back down to the abyss as I saw how everything I had done to improve was taken from me. This cycle continued until I reached the 2nd half of 10th grade in which I finally woke up one day and told my mom ""I want to fail 10th grade"". I was aware that I needed to do something or else I was going to die so I decided that I wanted to drop out, take a year off and fix my mind. As the months passed by I was making significant progress but I also faced many hardships because of my family. In the end of that year(2018), I emerged victorious in September or so I thought. I got back into a different school(a much harder one, this was a terrible idea from my dad), in that school everybody had to abandon who they were to become more efficient to survive in a harsh environment where they left way too much homework. I had no time for myself and this made things worse. I fell back to the abyss again at the half of the year, it was a slow build up but this time it was different. Keep in mind the cycle for this next part, I saw as everything was being taken away from me but this time slower so I grew desperate, trying to keep it together and no lose myself. I failed, this time I... I... I had lost everything, I finally lost it. All of my hope gone, all of my will gone, all of my strength gone, the only thing that was left was an empty husk laying down on the ground with a mind left completely in blank and lifeless eyes. No tears, no getting mad, just nothing, left there on the ground. My sanity was gone, all of my thoughts were negative, ANY positive thought was immediately disappeared in a sea of negativity. I was being controled by my anger, sadness, and most importantly fear for the next months. Everyday I cried until one day I said ""God I want to understand you and I want to know the secrets of the universe"". He responded me in 2 days, I felt this surge of hope when I heard it all. Of course the journey wasn't going to be easy, I picked myself up and I started meditating once more to be at peace with my anger first. My anger was very strong, I wanted blood, I wanted to kill people or myself. Like I said I lost everything so whatever choice I took it would not have mattered cause I wanted to die because I finally realized that life is meaningless. Well I finally got my peace with my anger, it only took me 2 months. Next my sadness, this was harder so it has taken me 4 months. Now I am facing my fears, the strongest one by far at least for me. Each person is different so the strongest one for you may be different. Why have I followed this path of wanting to be at peace with myself? Because I want to live my life to the absolute fullest. I am earning my freedom guys, I will not let fate kill me without a fight. I want to ask for advice now. How can I defeat my fear of the cycle repeating once more?

I hurt myself sometimes, and sometimes, when I'm doing the 2 hour drive home, I'll scream and cry the whole time. 

Othertimes, I don't eat for a few days and sometimes I eat and eat and eat like ive never eaten before. Sometimes I force myself to work nonstop, schedule myself so that I have absolutely no free time and no time to even think. Sometimes I dont do anything, despite my schedule. I just lay in bed and stare or sleep or read. I dont shower, or brush my teeth, or change my clothes. And then I think about how gross that is and I feel disgusted. So sometimes I disgust myself. 

Sometimes I do things I know I shouldn't and make up random stupid lies. I dont know why, I guess I just want people to like me. I'm afraid people will hate me if they really know all they shit I've been through. And my shit isnt even that bad, I just dont want anyone's pity. My shit is nothing compared to other's. And sometimes my friends talk about their problems, or they cry over boys for days on end and I just wanna scream at them. 

They have no idea what real pain is like. They dont know what it's like to be so sad you want to die. They dont know what it's like to feel nothing for weeks at a time. They dont know. I dont scream at them, of course. I sit with them, and hug them, and tell them they could do better. Or I send them memes and buy them coffee until they forget about Nathan, or Chase, or Elizabeth or however the next guy or girl is. And sometimes, every once in a while, I'll confess a part of it. I'll tell someone a bit of it and they'll be so sad for me. They'll be piteous and say, ""well, have you tried this?"" or ""oh, I was sad this one time and I did this."" And I appreciate that, and I love my friends, but they dont know. And they never will. 

I dont want them to try to fix me. I cant be fixed. I'm broken and that's just how it is. But they still try. I tell them about my parents, about my house or about what it was like during those last year of high school and they tell me to talk to my grandma or to fix it for my parents. I dont want to fix it. 

My mom has always told me that I'm the glue that's held our family together. And when my dad left, that's when I knew. I knew I was broken. Old and stale and I couldnt even do the one thing they needed me to. I couldnt keep us together. I wasnt even good at being glue. I could have tried harder. Worked more. Saved more money. But I didnt and I'll always resent myself for that. 

I've never told anyone that exactly. The wouldnt understand. They wouldnt understand how empty it is here, I'm my body. How sad and dark it is in my chest. I feel it. I didnt know sadness, heartbreak could be felt for real. But you can. I do. I feel it. And I'm not heartbroken because of a boy or a girl or a friend. 

I'm heartbroken because I'm not enough and I never will be. I wasnt enough for my parents, for my siblings, for my grandparents. I'm not enough for my best friend, or my clubs or fraternity. I'm not enough for school or classes or good grades. I just am broken and I'll always be. I'm shattered beyond repair and I hate wallowing like this. 

It sucks because I know there are people literally starving right now and I'm complaining about my shitty teenage years and shit that is my own shitty self's fault. How do people stop hating themselves? Does anyone actually ever stop hating themselves? Do they take medicine or something? Is that how people stop hating themselves? Stop being revolted when they look in the mirror or at pictures of themselves? 

I'm revolting, I dont know how people can even stand to be in my presence. All my friends like me for is that I'm funny. I know how to make people laugh. That's all I'm good for and I'm not even really all that good at it. I cant do jokes or anything like that, I just tell stories well. I'm a good narrator. I can twist a story into something worth hearing, even if it was just about a small purple rock I saw on my way to class. 

Sometimes I think about strange things, I wonder if others think about them too. I think about what would happen if I jumped out of a moving car on the highway, or what would happen if I just started walking in one direction and didnt stop. Or if I just played in bed and never got up for anything. Or if i stopped eating altogether. Its not like i need it anyway. 

I think all these self destructive things that i know i shouldnt do. Do others think about that too? Normal people? Am I fucked up? I dont think I'll ever be fixed. That's what I mena when I say broken. I have such a privileged life. Such a good life, yet I'm like this. Why am I so resentful? Billions of people have lived way worse lives in worse conditions yet I'm complaining. I hate that. Why cant I just be satisfied, why cant I just be happy? 

I'm sorry I keep doing this, texting you at midnight when I dont really have anywhere else to put my thoughts. I tried to draw or something, but it just kind of ended up sad. All the drawings were sad and cringy, like a late 2000's emo tumblr page. It sucks because if I ever told anyone everything, no dumbing it down or simplifying it or filtering it so it sounds better, no one would would look at me the same. They'd think of that thing I told them and that is all they would see when they looked at me. 

That's why I've never told anyone everything. Even my best friend for nearly 10 years, doesnt know. I suppose that's because we've had similar shit and I think she kind of knows anyway. Shes been kind of bad lately, shes my roommate. The one I know is being toxic. It sucks because I still love her. We have all this history and I dont want to just abandon that.

Shes getting married soon. I'm the maid of honor. And shes still weirdly shitty to me. I love her to bits and pieces and she knows me better than anyone else, the way I know her. She tells me virtually everything. It's me that's the one with secrets. I'm the one that's done bad things, that has horrible memories to tell. 

Shes good, one of the only good things I feel like I have, and shes not even that good. But we've had each other for ever and for a while, it was just us. For years, it was me and her against our families, against allthe bad. When we fought with friends, we always stuck with each ther. Always stayed at each others side. 

I know shes toxic, but shes never abandoned me. Shes never left and she never will. Now shes getting married, and I know its gonna be hard. I'll be away from one of the only people Ive ever had and she'll never think of me first again. She always think of him first. And I'll still think of her. She'll always be my best friend, even after we are both dead and gone. I'll always think of her first. 

So that's been hard. But I'm happy for her anyway. I'm afraid for her, but shes a big girl. She knows what she is doing. I already miss her. I'm afraid itll be like my mom. After she gets married, she want be her anymore. She'll be different. 

After my parents separated, mom was different. Shes never been the same. I lost my mother the day my dad left. I'll never have her back. I'm trying really hard to love this new woman, but it's hard. Shes meaner, harder to the world. She doesnt care about people as much, or about holidays or the cleaing schedule. She doesnt care about anyone really. Not me or my siblings, or our house or her friends. She hasn't talked to anyone in years, since it happened.

She hasnt gone to a party with them or gone out for coffee like she used to. She doesnt go to family gatherings either. My extended family always asks after her, tells me to tell her they love her, but she wont come. She says she doesnt need them or want to see them. I hate it a lot. 

I miss my mom. Who she was. I miss how it was when I was little. When my house was full of love and when we all played together. When we watched the king fead together on sunday nights or when we sat in the livingroom and played together. I miss how bright everything used to be. Now everything is always dark and gloomy. It seems like it's always rainy and cold, gloomy. 

The tree I climbed in and read under growing up died. It fell down. The garden died too. Mom stopped taking care of it. Nothing is the same and I dont know what to do or where I belong in this new place. I dont think my sister does either. I think thats why she always stays at her boyfriend's now. 

And I'm not there either. I feel bad for my brother. Hes so little. I know he is 14 now, but hes still tiny in my mind. My little brother. I didnt do good enough protecting him from it all. I just fucked off to college and left him alone in the mess that our family was in. I just couldnt anymore, I couldn't do it. I tried so hard at the time, I know I did. 

I remember being so tired that I would literally fall asleep standing up at times (which sounds impossible, I know, but it really happened. Multiple times). I remember being so sick of being alive and considering ending it nearly every day and the only reason I didnt is because I knew they needed me. I was their glue. I held them together. Until i couldn't anymore. Until i didnt anymore. Until i failed. 

That's just who i am, I suppose. A fucking failure. A meaningless nothing in this sad, empty fucking world. And it makes me angry, so angry that I feel like breaking my hand punching something, which I've done before so I know I could do it again. I wanna kick a wall until my toes bleed. Anything to feel something besides the angry. I know it would go away, because then I would only feel the pain. and it would buy me some time, a few weeks of nothing. Where I could call off work and just lay in bed and do nothing. 

I would feel better I think. I just want to do something, anything, to feel something else besides the nothing.

I just want to vent. I just discovered that the last several years I’ve been befriending and communicating with people online who were not who I thought they were. “Crazy” right? These people shared photos and videos of themselves and their families, we shared private and intimate details of our lives, things that were embarrassing. I erroneously let my guard down. After “knowing” them for years, I felt comfortable. But they knew my real identity very early on, and just let me play along, making an ass out of myself.

I wasn’t being entirely honest about everything either, who is online? But my emotions were genuine. I mean who the fuck wants people to know what the real you wants in bed?!

They had “problems”, and I would try to offer “advice”. I really actually believed them, and worried for them. It wasn’t until recently I realized they were describing scenarios that they thought applied to me. They would act as multiple people and get me to speak badly about their other persona, other people, or to talk about things that were sensitive and personal topics. They used my intimate details and secrets to expose/out me and to mock me. It was devastating, because I’d developed real feelings for these people. One day I woke up and discovered nothing and no one was real. I’m sure I hurt people along the way, but never ever intended to. My details were changed, but largely, I was me.

I would never intentionally hurt someone. I told lots of lies about my personal life for several reasons. Partly because I feared exactly what happened to me, and partly because I just didn’t have a lot of self esteem. My low self esteem and some of the abuse I’ve suffered over my life opened me up to become vulnerable and I paid the price for it. I wanted to feel connected, without physically connecting. Now I’m embarrassed, humiliated, saddened, fearful, but above all incredibly sad. My privacy was completely violated. I feel like it was some big experiment and people derived immense satisfaction from it. It was a sort of revenge. I understand what their goal was, but it doesn’t hurt any less. 

I know the people who did it are on here. To them, I want to say this:

I am a kind and generous person. I love with my whole heart. I am loyal, but not when hurt. I apologize to these “suspects” for any harm I caused them, actions that made them feel they had to do this to me, in order to teach me a lesson, in such a drawn out way. I wish they would have picked a phone up and TALKED to me, and learned about me, the real way, rather than taking underground and such complex routes.

Too many words, not enough action.

The worst part, is that I miss these people. My “imaginary” friends, but I’m too hurt, too paralyzed to move at the moment. There’s no going back, but it doesn’t hurt any less.

Anyway, I wanted to get it off my chest. And if they are listening, their secrets will always be safe with me. I don’t hate them, but I wouldn’t not give them the bird. I have decided to get off line. It really is a jungle out there. 

As today stands, I trust no one. Be careful about who you talk to online, and what you talk about. It really can hurt you. Words really can hurt. And that is the point, they wanted to drive home.

I'm 18F, and I've had a really bad outlook on death/mortality my entire life. When I was about seven, I used to be unable to sleep because I would contemplate the shortness of my life against the infinity of time. At the time the only way I could reasonably reconcile my limited time on this earth was placing immense pressure on myself to be ""successful,"" so I would have a long-lasting legacy when I inevitably passed. And I just developed a really toxic perfectionist attitude and a lot of general anxiety.

When I got older, this fear really started fucking with my mental health. I don't know exactly when it started but I started imagining vivid ways to kill myself whenever I felt anxious or like a failure. And it really messed me up, because my coping mechanism was basically a fantasy of the thing I feared the most. In high school I began developing (more so recognized) my internal philosophy that we are all not unique (in ways that are significant), which basically ruined the remaining shreds of my self-confidence and will to live. 

Now, I feel like I've reached a certain point of apathy where I'm just in a state of being ""casually/passively"" suicidal. I can't bring myself to commit suicide because I would feel so guilty doing so, but I really just want to go to sleep one night and never wake up. I guess I still have some hope for success since I am young, but every minor setback just seems so amplified in my mind and causes me to go down a slippery slope and I end up just wanting to die anyways.

The shittiest thing is there's literally no reason for me to feel this way; I can't pinpoint any traumatic childhood event that triggered this fear of death or led to this point of constantly wanting to die. I come from a decent family, with two parents and a pretty stable household. I guess the only negatives are that my dad was always pretty volatile and constantly criticizing me; and my mom would just avoid me when I used to have breakdowns and cry (not in a neglectful way though.. it was just her way of de-escalating the situation, but I do resent her a little for it). I just really don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to live because everything seems daunting and requires too much effort, but I really can't bring myself to kill myself either. And there's this added element of fearing death, and feeling guilty about not really having a reason for wanting to die in the first place... I dunno, I guess I'm just confused.

People are always seeking another way around to not deal with you. When situations get to complex for them they run and cannot handle the reality of what a depressed person look like.

Reality check, not all depressed people are that sad lonely girl crying cutting herself wearing a gothic look listening to depressing musics.

We come in a variety of appearances, but apparently being vengeful, disapointrd and taking action is not a depress thing to do.

This makes me feel bad for bombers, shooters, high school attackers because me and them are probably on the same boat. They were depressed people who got rejected from society and help groups. They had no choice but to self destruct. Then we go on calling them evil from my eyes they are people.

I dont feel normal though. I am surviving. I am terrified of trying to new meds cuz that just means another round of side effects. I forgot to mention i did cymbalta before lexapro and that was a fucking shit show.  


Is there any other way than just rolling the fucking dice on a new med? Ive been trying to pick at my brain and feel if its my dopamine or serotonin thats lacking.   


Are there any meds out there with higher success rates? that will just make me feel normal again. I just want to feel normal. thats it.

Next year I went back to another school, my at the time crush and some of my friends were there, although they were a year over me since they didn't drop out I still got to spend time with them, and I started taking care of my appearance again. I made some new friends and overall people seemed to like me.

I guess depression is something everyone is going to go through, either it will will come and go or stay with you for life - Maybe the same problem maybe something else.

When i read a lot of posts here, something i realize is that a lot of people are not just initially depressed over their personal issues but depressed of the lack of support they were hoping a ""Friend"" would give them during their time of hardship, this adds to their depression, actually sometimes this makes people forget the reason why they are depressed and makes them depressed over that, the realization that they are truly alone in times of hardship.

So what i am trying to say here is pick your friends wisely. We live in a world today where we make friends anywhere, we use this label loosely. We are not taught what qualities we should look for in a friend, we are not taught how you should treat a friend when it comes to all matters, we are actually made to figure all this stuff out by ourselves - which is wrong and very dangerous.

Set criteria for friendship, standards which are high. Now i can't tell you all what criteria you should have when choosing a friend, that's up to you, but for me, i want a friend who treats me and sees me the same way i see them, for my friends they know they can rely on me in all matters. Weather it be social matters i am there for them, if it be financial matters i am there for them, spiritual, physical whatever it may be, they know they can rely on me..and i can rely on them. I look for qualities in people which i myself have, that's what a friend should be a slight reflection of yourself, because when we fall that friend will know something is up with out even asking.

And obviously you wont be able to pick up these qualities in a person right away, it takes time, and until you are content with this person, then allow them in your world. 

I hope that helps. Peace be with you all.",True,False,[],False,depression,t5_2qqqf,591762,public,confidence,self,"At times of hardship that's when we know who our real friends are, Sadly for most they realize they didn't have a real friend to begin with.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/erahmh/at_times_of_hardship_thats_when_we_know_who_our/,no_ads,0.0

But I am not suicidal 
Ever since I was a teenager, I have never been a happy person. I was constantly sad and constantly heartbroken, 
Whenever I see people being happy, I get this sad feeling that I wish I could experience that someday, but it never came.
Some years ago, I met someone; her existence in my life, made me very very happy.
But, she had gotten together with someone. And her SO does not like me being in contact with her so she had to cut ties with me and that source of happiness was long gone, her absence in my life devastated me a lot. Its like the only thing that made you happy was ripped away from you. 
I started to drink daily to cope with that and the unhappiness I constantly felt and I have not stopped.  
She would secretly contact me at times, and whenever she did, I would be happy. And I guess one day her SO found out, and it caused some issues with her relationship. As much I would want my happiness constanly, I didn’t want to ruin hers, so I decided to part ways. In a very dramatic manner, I know I would be pestering her constantly, so I made her cut ties with me in every possible way. 
Again I did everything I could I my power to search for a source of happiness. 
I travelled, I worked like mad(Thankfully, this has let me rise in my career) tried new hobbies, tried every single fucking thing I could imagine.
I tried to get used to the unhappy life by lying to myself that everything is fine and alright, I tried shoving down the feeling of being unhappy, lonely and sad. The more I shoved it down, the more it hurt. And eventually, I would just randomly break down and cry at random places. 
The more this was going on the more I isolated myself from everyone and everything. 
It came to a point that I started feeling that this life is not worth living. 
I started having thoughts of ending it. Which is nothing new to me. 
One day a couple of weeks back, I was sitting in isolated area where I usually go to as no one comes there. 
I was thinking of my life. And I broke down crying uncontrollably.
I started to plan to end it. I planned when i would do it, what I do before I would do it and how I would do. 
Just as I started to convince myself to do it, the person I mentioned earlier came back into my life at that very moment. 
I was happy. 
Few days later, I brought her out for dinner and some drinks, I felt something that I have not felt in years, I was happy. Really very happy. 

But I know she just treats me as a best friend. And I also know, the day is gonna come where I will have to eventually fully give her up. And I know I wont be able to take It. 

So couple of days back, I told her I am moving to another country, she asked me why? I told her I am going on search of happiness, she didn’t buy that answer, she asked again, 
I told her what exactly I felt. I didn’t expect an answer and I know what her answer will be. 
And I told her, I would like to bring her out for dinner one last time before I go.

I am not moving to another country, I am giving up on life. 
As much as I don’t want to do it, I just cant stand life anymore

Can't be the only one who's going through this. 20 yrs old (21 in April), dropped out of college two years ago to get into a family business in the middle of a ghost town, just to save up money and maybe hone my art skills in order to get into a private art college. Instead, I'm chasing my own tail, rolling a boulder of my own problems uphill, only to then slip midway through and end up rolling it back up again, all the while constantly daydreaming for a career I'll never be able to get. Every. Single. DAY.

Having a hard time being productive around my folk's store (losing memory, moving at a slow pace, so fucking weak to carry even the lightest box, etc). My stepdad's pushing me to be better, but I just don't wanna work. It's a necessary step to be prepared when I move to a different job in the adult world, yes, but I hate it. HATE it. Demanding, competitive, and just awful. I'm afraid to move out of family's store for another job because I know I won't last long no thanks to harboring a lot of anger issues and lack of coordination. It's gotten to the point where my stepdad's gotten fed up with my performance and just gets angry at me. I don't blame him for losing his patience, though. He's not a bad person, just so we're clear. He's been training for about eight months and I've still not made any progress. I really can't do anything right. I've practically wasted my folk's time on the go and heap more problems on them just as soon as step in their store.

Job sucks because they got me as an employee. Daydreaming sucks even more. Got these characters in my head for some fantasy epic that I've had stuck in there since middle school, hoping to one day show my work through art, only to still be trap in it, while my success in art remains stagnant and mediocre. Keep popping up whenever I got a cool idea or just try to distract myself a bit. And yet, I'm not dedicated to drawing . Tried a couple of times, last five minutes for session. Want to go back to doing them again, but nothing happens. Just sit on my ass, hoping my art will get good on a whim. That's it.

After the day ends, I come home to play my favourite fantasy RPGs and jerk off to porn. Would want to atleast attempt to do some art, but I just can't give up on the other two. Happens every night. Work a full day in a demanding and then play with myself at night. That's all I do. Just distracting myself while the world around me continues to move on and ignore my presence.

It's 3:46 AM as I'm writing this. Tried to sleep at the right time (around 10:30 to be specific), but instead, I'm fully awake because my mind feels I'm like having a hangover. Listening to lofi music to try to distract myself a bit.  So tired yet my head hurts if I go back to bed. Just for once, I would like to sleep forever.

I’m depressed a lot, and whilst I go out to try &amp; distract myself from it - I always think “I should be doing more” “I should be putting in more effort” but then there’s messages like “be yourself!” “Don’t put someone 100% first or you’ll be Dissapointed” and it honestly hurts more when I have to do stuff relating to myself. It makes me constantly question myself. My sexuality feels unreal, since I’ve never been in a true relationship of any sort. I’m sick of over feeling for people who don’t even want me. I should have gotten over this by now.

**Tl;Dr at bottom**

My boyfriend and parents both came to the consensus that I need to make friends. I know how that sounds, but I do know they're worried about me- And probably for good reason.  
I only hang out: with my bf, with my parents, by myself/with my cat.   
I only have like... One internet friend. And I think I'm about to lose them as well.

The need to have friends isn't really there. Yeah, I feel lonely and isolated/left out sometimes, but I'm *content* with my life- It's going alright and that's fine with me.   
I just don't feel I have the mental or emotional capacity to constantly hang out, talk, or keep people happy.   
I've also been told I have a messed up view on relationships, and that may be true as I've been in more than a few... Unsavory friend and relationships-- So that may also be a factor.

It's not a matter of not socializing, I work in a very social-oriented job, and I'm usually at a climbing gym and out-and-about at coffee shops, parks, or general hang-out spots. I do talk to people, and we hit it off, but I don't want to take it to a friend level.  
I can't tell a lot of the times if someone really wants to be friends with me or just wants to be *more*, which I don't want. And it hurts.

I also have trouble making plans and replying to people over text, I have periods where I go radio silent over dm's for weeks to months.  


This has turned into a whole vent/rant thing, oops.  
**How do I make friends so I can make my family and bf stop worrying about me?**

I am in therapy, btw, I'm still learning how to open up to her and actually talk about my problems, though.

And then I thought “I wish I was on anti-depressants!” and then it hit me. It was like a weird realization. The reason why I wanted anti-depressants wasn’t because I wanted to get better but it was because I wanted to transform myself into the sort of person that would impress my parents and give them pride. I wanted to be the person they would love. That they’d be happy with. I genuinely thought that anti-depressants would change me into that person. That it would give me motivation to do shit.

Other than that I got better y’know i stopped crying I went to the bathroom, got panadol y’know the good stuff. It’s weird because I was so set on the idea that anti-depressants was the definite answer and I know for some people it definitely is and has been. But I guess my question was how can I make my family proud of me instead of how can I be a happier person.

The industrial sounds in the beginning remind me of walking into the hospice facility that my grandmother was held at previously before she was moved to her final death place, a facility right down the road, much more peaceful.

When I walked in, I was surrounded by death, the constant beeping that would be the timer counting down to the ends of the lives of these suffering souls. As I walked down the halls, I looked into the rooms. I saw old women and men sitting there, just staring blankly. They had lost themselves to time, or had been eaten up by some monstrous disease. As I walked into my grandmother's room, I broke down crying. I saw her as she was, and could not handle it. What I had once known as one of the most important people of my life, someone I looked up to, was frail and weak, skin and bones, in a hospice facility, suffering from her horrible disease. I walked up to her, still crying. She asked if I was crying, and I sobbed a ""yes"". She understood. She, with little strength she had, held my head on her hands and let me cry. She told me not to cry and that it was fine - even though I felt like it wasn't. 

She managed through it for 3 more months. Then, sometime right before halloween, the 27th I believe, she succumbed to her disease and passed away. The last I ever saw of her, I promised her that I would watch north by northwest with her. It never happened.

So John, you just want to feel great doing grandiose things. And you can't seem to be settling for anything else. You want to build big big things and look at the big picture and the design an all that. Because nothing is ever enough. You don't want to be just another person walking down the street. You want to be bigger and you want it all to be grand and exciting. 

Let us talk about how to get there. To this grandiosity. What does it take.  How should you get there. What should you do. What should you do differently. What can you learn from others. 
.
.
.
Why do you feel like all is done. Why can't nothing be done. Why is it all over. Why should you die. 
Because you can't do it. Its not possible by you. Because you suck. You are just an order of magnitude below it all, below everyone else. Nobody cares about you. Because all is a burden. Because you can't get yourself to do anything, because it is all disorganised and you are not even trying. Because you don't want to do anything. Because even you know that you are not capable of it. Because you think you can never do the kind of things done by the big people. You think they are fundamentally different from you and it is impossible for you to achieve the same. Because you are weak and weaklings don't deserve to exist, because they are just a burden and a liability. Because they suck. Because even you can't support yourself in logic on why you should not die. 
You die not because you don't deserve to live, not for others' wishing you dead but because you choose not to live. Death is a choice - don't blame it on the society. It is on you. It is your call. You decide how much you should care about the society, if it is even something worth considering after all in your universe. The world is a harsh place and it always has been. If it is all about society, where do you get the conceit that the society cares about you living or dead. It doesn't give a fuck, either way. So don't blame it on the society. They dont care. You life is your choice, caring about the society is your choice, dogma is your choice, caring about winning or losing is your choice, judging yourself is your choice, caring about anyone is your choice, categorising everyone as one entity is you choice, asking validation from them is your choice, expecting meaning from outside is your choice, not wanting to do anything is your choice, what you choose to learn is your choice, what you do is your choice. Always take a step back and look at the whole picture. Dont blame it on anything. You don't even have the right to blame your past. That was a different self following different rules, living in a different philosophical world, that was a DIFFERENT PERSON. All you can do now is what you choose to do now, think now, follow now. That is what you are in charge of. That is in your control - it is the control variable that you can mess with. 
So don't go around living in a philosophy you don't like and then blaming that for everything. If society is not a philosophy you can work with, then chuck it, don't follow it. Nobody cares. Be selfish, understand the system and do what you want to do, hack it. Don't drag around the societal entities or even care about them. Don't give a damn about it, like this is not fair and bla bla blah. It is what it is. Hack it and do what you want. Don't give a fuck and don't expect anyone else to do so either. Run your machine and do what you want to do.

She has been struggling with severe depression for years and she always told us she was going to kill herself one day, she told us that she knew how, she knew when and she knew where. This as why we basically convinced her to go to the doctor and she has taking antidepressants for a couple of months now. Obviously me and the other people on the group chat were shocked seeing the messages. So I called her right away. She picked up crying and immediately started to shout at me du through the phone saying goodbye and that she hopes I can forgive her one day. So I called 911 and asked them to go to her house (I live 30 minutes away so they could get their before me). I hoped into an uber and raced down the road to her house. When I got there the paramedics had already gone up to her apartment and they brought her down to the ambulance. She seemed physically fine but her face just showed no emotion. I didn't get to talk to her. They took her directly to a psychiatric hospital. I'm going to visit her later today (if she can receive visitors). I feel still very uneasy about this whole situation.

My timeline starts with me acting out as a child (typically after hanging out with friends or some other stressful event, I realize now), which my parents brushed off as me being a horribly behaved child and reference how difficult I was, always saying they hoped I'd have a child ""just like me."" My dad told me that he didn't have a temper until I was born. I have since begun to attribute my behavior to some of my parents' parenting techniques.

That matured as I became a teenager. I got my first feelings of really deep sadness probably in high school. I remember feeling so empty and blank that I couldn't think, I felt like a robot. I struggled with eating disorders and a ton of self-hatred. But on the surface, I was fine. Heck, I felt fine a lot of the time when I was distracted and around people. It's when I was alone and not busy (I kept myself very busy) that I really felt these things.

Fast-forward to today. I feel like I struggle with some sort of high-functioning depression (but I hate to diagnose myself, it feels wrong and I have this constant mentality that I need to suck it up and that I'm fine because mental health wasn't really a ""thing"" when I was young) and it can really affect me. I can go to work, go to my social activities, the gym, but I don't get enjoyment out of anything. Everything feels like a chore. I am exhausted after putting up a facade. I have good and bad days, but today is definitely a bad day that has had some lead-up. My fiance is such a sweet man, but he doesn't understand these concepts. I really try to explain things to him, but he takes them personally. For example, when I start to feel these feelings coming on, I begin to get more irritable, less affectionate, and then if we fight because of that, I completely shut down. I don't want to be touched, I don't want affection, and it's not because I'm mad. I'm just numb. I know I should see a therapist, but there is always a voice in the back of my head telling me I'm fine. I'm not lying in bed all day or considering harmful activities, but I feel like I need some sort of help.

My ven-behaviour is disturbing.  For instance I recently had a homosexual encounter (I'm 44 with 2 kids and have never been attracted to men).  That is only one example from many of a complete transformation in character.

My last depression was bad and I know without doubt another will return if I stop this medicine.  By bad I mean horrific - I was going to die.  

I have tried every medication so top tips aren't necessary.

My second group I was really good friends/best friends actually with (called L) a girl who I thought reciprocated that friendship. I was there for her when times were tough and I mean tough. I gave her a place to stay when she had nowhere to go, I was a shoulder to cry on and we used to do loads together. She moved away for a job and is now living with her fiance who is a really nice guy. I recently went to visit them for a house warming party they were throwing. I travelled for six hours there and back so I could be there because our friendship means alot ro me. When I arrived at the house I noticed that there were engagement cards on the mantelpiece. I asked one of my other friends there is she knew about this and she said yes. I confronted my friend L and she said ""oh we're not really telling people we are just sort of telling people as we see them."" So I thought right ok, and then another one of our mutual friends shows up and she has also travelled a hell of a long way for a few hours' worth of partying. She had brought an engagement card and a present. Made me feel like total shit for not even knowing that one of my supposedly closest friends got engaged. 
I feel like I have no one, my bf is great and I love him but, I need a friendship I need that bond that you have with a really close pal, someone that you send weird memes to and someone that wants to actually spend time with you as a mate. My friend L hasn't really put the effort in. After that house warming I sent her a message saying it was good to see you etc. She saw the message but didn't reply. 
I just feel like I needed to vent. I do have acquaintances and people that I see on a semi-regular basis but I don't have a best close friend and I feel so alone because everyone I know is so far away and those that are close it feels like they just don't care about me.

I used to be a chipper happy go lucky person if I believed what people used to say but after a few events of what happened in my family I think I changed. I became more pessemistic, angry and sarcastic and I hate it.

I don't show that side of me to my family or friends ever since making them worry would be selfish of me and I don't want them to feel sad because of me, I thought of doing therapy but I don't want anyone to find out so I never did it.

I thought it would get better but every day I find myself feeling more and more depressed.  
I used to get bullied everyday in high school and had no friends (23 now) and I had no problem overcoming that and I've changed so much since then but what I'm felt then is nothing compared to how I feel now despite my life (to a degree) being in a much better position.
I have a job that I enjoy, I'm studying at uni and my life is on track but I find myself angry at everyone and everything over the smallest things.  I struggle to look forward to anything anymore.  I look forward to getting home from work and end up just lying in bed for hours worrying about the future.  For the last 5 years now I've been heavily reliant on drugs and alcohol daily to try and feel better.  I know this is a big part of my problem and I can't stop myself.  I honestly don't know what to do anymore.  I wouldn't say I'm suicidal because I could never bring myself to do it because of how it would affect my friends and family but I can't keep living like this.
Would love to talk to someone who's been through similar to help with coping mechanisms and tips on how to make myself become a better, happier person.

I don’t think I could do it myself...
I have an amazing 9 year old son and even though I’m not a great mum I couldn’t do it to him. He will probably end up leaving me like everyone else does anyway.

I barely have 2 friends. All their other friends are way more important than I am. 
I have a good boyfriend. But I just never feel good enough. And my anxiety keeps going in my head that there is someone else. Someone better. 
It’s hard to not believe knowing how crap I am.

I have no job. I’m 28 and unemployed, even though I have been trying so hard for about 4 years now. I can’t even get any interviews.
